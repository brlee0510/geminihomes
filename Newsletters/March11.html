  <strong>Building</strong><strong><br />
  <strong>Success 101 </strong></strong> <br />
  <em>Q: What is a &quot;rough-in&quot;?</em></p>
A: &quot;Rough-in&quot; is  a construction term that refers to the infrastructure or &quot;guts&quot; of a  particular system in a house. This can include the pipes for the plumbing  fixtures or the ducts for the heating and cooling equipment. Some rough-ins may  be left &quot;capped&quot; (or &quot;stubbed&quot;) behind a finished wall or  ceiling for the homeowner to add a product later, as the budget allows or as  part of a planned expansion project.</td>

          <p class="text">Whether it's  saving two cents on a gallon of gas or building your dream home, everybody  wants a bargain.<br />
            Everyone  loves a deal. No one likes paying retail.<br />
            If you are  considering building a new home, now or over the next year or two, you face a  number of difficult questions...</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text">Can       I do better if I wait to build my home? </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="text">Will       interest rates go lower? </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="text">Have       home values bottomed or will there be further declines? </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text">On the  surface, it may seem as though the housing market has yet to begin climbing out  the hole it fell into nearly three years ago. But we see a number of key  indicators that point to some compelling reasons why now may be the time to get  the best value for your home building investment.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Home  Prices:</strong> Like the stock market, it is impossible to pick the bottom of the current  housing market. No one can say with certainty that we've hit the absolute  bottom. Like any market, supply and demand impact price. The inventory of older  homes continues to dwindle. According to the Census Bureau, the US will add  over a million new households each year. The current supply of new homes coming  on line is nowhere near that number. As the demand for new homes rise, so will  prices.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Interest  Rates:</strong> We've already seen mortgage and construction loan interest rates inch up in  2011. They are likely to maintain that trend as the overall economy and demand  for new homes continues to improve.</p>
          <p class="text">If you  determine that interest rates are likely to go up, acting now can save money.  Every quarter-point change in interest rates is equivalent to approximately  $6,000 for each $100,000 borrowed over the course of a 30-year fixed-rate  mortgage.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Materials  and Labor Costs:</strong> We are in the middle of a commodity boom. The global demand for raw materials  from countries like China and other emerging markets continue to put upward  pressure on commodity prices. As the price of raw materials goes up, so do  housing costs.</p>
          <p class="text">In addition,  those manufacturers, suppliers, and trade contractors who are still standing  after the housing bust did so by streamlining their operations and honing their  costs of doing business. They are running very lean. In all likelihood, these  companies will raise prices if there is an increase in demand for new housing.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Streamlined  Operations:</strong> In order for our company to prosper during this difficult business cycle, we've  had to sharpen our operations and systems, cut the fat out of our ledgers and  operate on thin margins. As a result we are poised to meet our current demand  with better processes, improved technology and lower overhead. Those  efficiencies translate into lower costs for homebuyers willing to invest in a  new-home project today.</p>
          <p class="text">If you can  look past the headlines and scare tactics, you may realize that in these times,  the best time to build a new home may be about to slip away.</p>
