            <strong>Success 101 </strong></strong> <br />
            <em>Q: Whom should I call when there's a problem with a kitchen  appliance?</em></p>
A: Depending on the status  and terms of your builder's warranty, you have several options. Even if the  warranty has expired, you may still contact your builder to inquire about  maintenance, repair, or replacement options. A local appliance store or  maintenance company (perhaps even the original seller or installer) may be of  service, as might be the appliance manufacturer. Consult your homeowner's  manual and appliance user guides for troubleshooting tips.</td>

        <td><p class="title2">Maintaining Your Dream Home 
          </p>
          <p class="text">We pride  ourselves on building and delivering homes that bring our clients' vision and  imagination into reality. We build dreams. Along with a focus on aesthetics, we  construct homes that are designed to maintain their luster and beauty for  decades. But this is only possible if a home is nurtured and cared for over  time.</p>
          <p class="text">Once they  have settled into their new home, it becomes increasingly the client's  responsibility to maintain it. As a professional builder, we have a period of  time in which we respond to warranty service calls and address questions from  our new homeowners. Eventually the baton is passed to our owners for regular  home maintenance. This helps insure a comfortable, secure and safe living  environment and protects an important financial investment over time.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">And while every  house we build is slightly different, specifically with regards to the various  exterior and interior finishes, (from the roofing to the countertops, flooring,  and paint coatings) they all need to be cared for properly to retain our  clients' investment and maximize their quality of life. We see it as our  responsibility to educate and help our clients tackle their role as 'good  stewards' of their home.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><em><strong>Wood  Floors.</strong></em> All types of wood flooring material, whether solid wood, composite, or  laminate, require regular care. For prefinished products, no waxing is  required. Clean these surfaces using a regular application of warm, soapy  water. To maximize the life of wood flooring, keep it dry and free of debris  that can cause scrapes and discolor the finish.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><em><strong>Drainage.</strong></em> An engineered  combination of a home's roof design, gutter system, and placement on the lot,  work together to shed water from the house and its foundation. To maintain an  optimum level of drainage, have gutters cleaned twice a year, ideally before  the rainy seasons.&nbsp; Also, adjust the gutter's downspouts to empty into  splash blocks or extend at least two feet away from the home's exterior walls.  If you add shrubs, flowerbeds, or other landscaping around your house, angle  (or grade) the dirt away from the home's foundation.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><em><strong>Appliances.</strong></em> Refer to your  homeowner's manual or binder to find the user manuals to all of the kitchen and  other major appliances in the house. These guides typically include seasonal  and periodic maintenance tips. For instance, your refrigerator coil should be  cleaned twice a year; check the seal of the door gasket, as well, to make sure  you're not wasting energy. In addition, the clothes dryer vent hose (between  the dryer and the wall) and the vent louvers on the outside of the house should  be cleaned out at least semi-annually. Every three months, replace the furnace  filter, clean out the dishwasher strainer, and drain and flush sediment from  your water heater. Such maintenance chores allow these appliances to operate at  their optimal performance and extend their usable lives.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><em><strong>Air  ducts and ventilation.</strong></em> Air ducts and vent registers can become clogged or  stifled with debris, reducing their ability to distribute conditioned air and  keep your house comfortable. About every two years, hire a professional service  company to clean them out. For the same reason, clean the filters and check the  general operation of ventilation fans in the kitchen and bathrooms so they work  efficiently, as well.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><em><strong>Roofing.</strong></em> Make regular and  thorough roof inspections. Pay attention for missing or damaged shingles or  voids in the flashing that may allow moisture or air infiltration. Replace or  repair as soon as possible to ward off problems that can occur unnoticed or  unseen.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">By following  these guidelines, the time and energy owners invest in their home will continue  to provide dividends well into the future.<span class="text"><br />
