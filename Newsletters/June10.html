              <strong>Success 101 </strong></strong> <br />
              <em>Q: The &quot;green&quot; benefit: Building vs Remodeling</em></p>
A: Building a new house  affords you the opportunity to consider the entire house with a systematic,  comprehensive approach to energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and overall  performance. While improvements to an existing home may make a partial dent in  that structureâ€™s energy use (perhaps in one portion of the house), a new home  built to high environmental standards will be far more efficient and perform  better because the whole house benefits from better building materials and  methods than those of the past.</td>

        <td height="1694"><p><strong>Green Building: What it is and why  it matters </strong><br />
            <span class="text">Green  building, sustainability and high-performance homes are now part of the  vocabulary of new home construction. We welcome the attention brought to these  important issues. As professional builders, however, we take the subject with a  grain of salt. Green building is a far more complex topic than that portrayed  in the media. News spots or magazine articles typically focus on specific areas  like insulated windows, high-efficiency furnaces, roof-mounted solar panels, or  recycled-content flooring.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Certainly,  those products provide measurable benefits in terms of energy savings and  improved use of natural resources, but genuine green building is much more  complex. A green builder uses a systematic approach to design, construction,  and on-going operational durability in which the sum of the benefits are far  greater than the individual components. A green builder also knows how to  personalize the green building approach to each homebuyer's needs and budget,  carefully balancing the value that the client places on the benefits of green  building as opposed to other choices available for new home construction.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">It is true  that all homes (and all buildings) leave an environmental  &quot;footprint.&quot; The materials we builders use in new construction use  natural resources, such as trees and metal ores, even oil. The important goals  of green building are to reduce the amount of natural resources required to  build a house, and then to lessen the amount of energy used by the house.  Energy efficiency over the life of the house further reduces the natural  resources needed to produce electricity and natural gas.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">To achieve  those goals, we look for building materials, products, and systems that make  the most (or best) use of every resource harvested while also performing better  than traditional products. For example, an engineered beam uses smaller,  fast-growing trees. Twice as much of each log can be used to make an engineered  beam as compared with a comparably sized &quot;glue-lam&quot; beam created in a  sawmill.&nbsp; An engineered beam can also span longer, open spaces and resist  warp better. A house that is free of even the smallest gaps does not waste  energy.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Various  green building certification programs are now available to help builders create  more sustainable and resource-efficient homes. As we review them, however, we  often find that the building practices we already have in place meet or exceed  those standards. That's good news for our homebuyers and owners because it  means we're already providing a high-performance home -- i.e., a home with many  green features -- without adding to the cost or price. Of course, a client may  choose to add additional features as budget, needs, and passion for the  environment dictate.<br />
            With a  systematic approach to green or sustainable building, we can build a new home  that not only leaves as small an environmental footprint as possible, but also  delivers convenience, comfort, safety, and a high level of value.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Warm Regards,</span><br />
