          <p><em>Q: What is &quot;slump&quot;?</em></p>
A: In concrete circles, a  &quot;slump&quot; refers to the consistency or degree of wetness of freshly  mixed concrete, and therefore its workability and eventual strength properties.  Building codes and standards may require a specific slump mix or acceptable  range of slump to ensure the concreteâ€™s structural integrity when poured.<p>&nbsp;</p></td>

        <td height="1694" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><h1>Solid  Ideas for Controlling Concrete </h1>
          <p>It's easy to  take concrete for granted. Most of us think of concrete as something stable,  enduring, and strong. We believe that once concrete is set as a foundation  slab, patio, driveway, or path, it's there to stay.<br />
            </p>
          <p>While it's  true that concrete is arguably one of the most stable building materials  available, it nevertheless requires special care to perform as expected,  maintain its structural integrity and retain its aesthetic appeal.<br />
          </p>
          <p>This level  of care and attention to detail starts with the proper mix of sand, cement, and  water. For a given application, such as a foundation wall or slab, ratios are  specified by a structural engineer. The mix varies based on soil conditions,  climate, building codes, and other factors, and is essential to ensure the  concrete will perform as designed and desired.<br />
          </p>
          <p>To  strengthen the concrete to withstand a variety of forces, it will likely have  to be reinforced with steel. For foundation footings and concrete walls,  contractors rely on reinforcing steel bars (or rebar) to bolster the concrete  against shifts in the soil or seismic activity. For a driveway, patio, or path,  a mesh of lighter-gauge steel placed within the concrete pour is adequate to  provide additional strength and stability.<br />
          </p>
          <p>As the mix  is being poured into forms or across a slab, air pockets must be removed to  eliminate any voids that would result in weak spots within the concrete. In  fact, wet concrete may have as much as 20% of its volume made up of trapped  air, usually around rebar or at form junctions.<br />
          </p>
          <p>To eliminate  these pockets in walls and footings, a concrete contractor will insert a  vibrating rod into the wet concrete and slowly draw it out to let the concrete  fill in its wake. For slabs and other flat concrete pours, a smaller vibrator  or a tamp will do the trick.<br />
          </p>
          <p>It is also  important to smooth the surface of the concrete, especially if it is to be left  exposed to the elements. Contractors use a variety of trowels and long-handled  screeds, darbies, and floats that progressively smooth the surface so that it  not only looks good, but helps shed water and debris, makes it easier to sweep,  and is generally more durable.<br />
          </p>
          <p>As the  smoothing process progresses and the concrete begins to harden (or &quot;set  up&quot;), the contractor will also cut shallow, V-shaped control joints at  strategic locations within the slab. </p>
          <p>These joints serve to &quot;attract&quot;  and collect the inevitable surface cracks that will occur as the concrete cures  or dries to its final, hardened state. Such cracks are non-structural, but  unsightly. With the use of control joints, surface cracks occur along the  joints, reducing their visual impact.<br />
          </p>
          <p>Once the  control joints are cut and the surface smoothed or textured to its desired  state (perhaps with a pattern for added aesthetic value), it's simply a matter  of time -- usually within 48 hours -- before the concrete cures and is strong  enough for the home's structural frame, vehicle traffic, or a summer barbecue.</p>
          <p>Warm Regards,<br />
