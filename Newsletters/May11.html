          <p>To  all of our old friends and new,<br />
            I  feel that the best compliment that I can receive is a referral from a past  client to a friend, family member or aquantance. I would very much appreciate  if you would please, forward this E-Newsletter to those people you know who are  most likely to build or remodel in the future or anyone else whom you believe  that may benefit from receiving it. They can just click the  &quot;Subscribe&quot; at the bottom to keep receiving in the future or  &quot;Unsubscribe&quot; at any time in the future that they feel they are not  getting any benefit from our newsletter.<br />
            Thanks  for your help in advance!<br />

  <em>Q: What is hot water recirculation?</em></p>
A: A hot water  recirculation system uses a small pump attached to the hot water line to a  homeâ€™s showers, tubs, and faucets that circulates cold water out of the line to  deliver hot water faster and mitigates the amount of water wasted as you wait  for it to heat up (called lag time). Often activated by a switch or button in  the kitchen or baths, the system can reduce lag time to a matter of seconds  instead of minutes, reducing water use at those locations by 30 percent or  more.</td>

      <tr>
        <td height="1694"><p><strong>Nothing to Fear </strong></p>
<p class="text">Do you know  what most often hinders the success of a new-home project? Fear. Fear of the  unknown, of unscrupulous contractors, shoddy materials, of somehow getting  caught in a money pit and ending up holding the bag.</p>
          <p class="text">This  high-level of concern is understandable. Often our clients' home is their  largest single investment. For many, this is their first experience building a  home. And for all there is a lot to learn about new home construction.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">As  professional builders, we understand and respect our clients' concerns. Our job  is to demystify the building process, help our clients identify and understand  their concerns and overcome them quickly and confidently.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">In addition  to being good listeners and problem-solvers, professional builders operate on  solid business principles and practices that alleviate the majority of what  clients often fear about the homebuilding process, including:<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Reliable  partners.</strong> We seek out, work with, and retain top-quality subcontractors and materials  suppliers. Our trade partners possess similar philosophies and approaches to  running a successful business and are committed to the same high level of  construction quality and standards. This helps mitigate disputes, foster  cooperation and produce better-built homes.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">We  constantly review our trade relationships to ensure that their pool of subs and  suppliers consistently delivers high-quality work at a fair price. That  diligence protects your investment and helps remove the fear of poor  workmanship and unreliable performance.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Record  keeping.</strong> The best builders are diligent (some say obsessive) about documenting their  new-home projects to make sure costs, schedules and progress align and meet  their standards of quality and those of their clients.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">For the same  reason, professional builders demand similar diligence and reporting from their  trade partners -- not so much to keep them in line, but more to enable their  own accounting processes to be complete, accurate and current.<br />
            As such, professional  builders can present completely transparent and reliable reports at any time to  their clients to ease concerns about whether their new home project is on  track.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Protection.</strong> People having a new  home built for them are often afraid that they'll somehow be on the hook for  unpaid work or materials once the job is over and their builder has moved on to  his next house. It's a legitimate fear and an all-too-common reality.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">These  concerns are easily managed by professional builders. As part of their standard  business practices, they pay their bills on time and only from each project's  budget. In addition, they routinely collect lien releases from their trade  partners upon satisfactory completion of their work.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Collecting  lien releases on a timely basis (as the project progresses, not just at the  end) removes the chance that a subcontractor or materials supplier will make a  claim for payment against a new home; in fact, the best builders provide copies  of those lien releases so that owners can rest assured that the bills have all  been paid.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Sophisticated  builders practice &quot;fear management&quot;. They take a professional  approach to their business and are sensitive to the concerns of their clients.  They help clients manage any anxiety from project inception through final  walk-through. The key, as always, is communication. Helping clients manage  their fear goes a long way to keeping communication lines open and promote a  satisfying experience for all.</p>
          <span class="text"> Warm Regards,</span><br />
