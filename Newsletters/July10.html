              <strong>Success 101 </strong></strong> <br />
              <em>Q: What's a good payback or return on investment for a  &quot;green&quot; product?</em> </p>
A: That's difficult to say  without knowing the exact product in question or how it is being applied in the  construction or operation of a house. A reasonable, but rough rule of thumb is  about 5 years. Within that time, the premium you paid for a product or system  to save energy or water should &quot;pay back&quot; or be recouped by the  savings in your energy or water bills. In addition, be sure to factor in any  tax credits or financial incentives you earned by using that product.</td>

        <td height="1694"><p><strong>Greenwashing: Beware! </strong> <br />
            </p>
          <p><span class="text">The term  &quot;green&quot; is being increasingly applied as an easy way to identify  products, including building materials and new homes, as having a better or  smaller impact on the environment.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">That's fine  for marketing slogans and advertising headlines, but it's also dangerous if the  product (or house) isn't truly sensitive to its environmental impact and is  simply trying to ride the coattails of a sincere effort to lessen our carbon  footprint.<br />
            In those  instances, intended or not, the term &quot;greenwashing&quot; comes into play.  Simply, it refers to incomplete, insincere, exaggerated, or downright untrue  promises made about a product's environmental performance, with no real  evidence to back it up.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">As a  professional builder confronted with &quot;green&quot; claims from a variety of  building product manufacturers and some competitors, we are keenly aware of the  threat that greenwashing can have on our credibility as a quality contractor.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">So, in our  business, we make every effort to substantiate the claims made by our suppliers  regarding reduced water use, recycled content, energy efficiency, and other  performance characteristics that relate to creating a &quot;green&quot;  building.<br />
            How?  Thankfully, the &quot;green&quot; movement within and outside of the building  industry has spawned a wealth of independent, third-party companies that  scientifically verify those claims with a battery of standards and test  methods. When considering a product or system, we look for certifications from  those entities, as well as specific performance information (such as the  precise amount of energy the furnace claims to save) to give us confidence.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">In addition,  several local, state, and national &quot;green&quot; building programs, such as  Energy Star, have cropped up to help us and other builders identify materials  and methods that result in better-built homes. These programs not only serve as  frameworks for higher-quality housing, but also refer to the independent  verification programs, such as the EPA's WaterSense (for low-flow plumbing  fixtures), to give us greater assurance that we are truly building green.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Even then,  however, manufacturers and some builders may unintentionally misuse the  certifications they earn from such testing or evaluation. For instance, there's  no such thing as an &quot;eco-friendly'&quot; or  &quot;environmentally-sensitive&quot; product or house, two terms that have no  scientific basis and smack of greenwashing.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Failing to  go the extra mile to verify environmental performance claims can put us at risk  of becoming greenwashers, too. It's also our responsibility to surround  so-called green products and systems with a quality-built house that  effectively optimizes the energy use, water use, and durability of those  products.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">That way, we  can all feel good, and be confident in, your investment and our combined  efforts to make the Earth a healthier place to live for us and future  generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Warm Regards,</span><br />
