  <h3>Building Success 101</h3>

<p><em>Q: What is an allowance?</em></p>
A: An allowance is a budget  item for certain products and finishes, such as appliances or flooring. It  allows a new-home buyer to select any product that is within the allowance  amount, whether offered by the builder or another source. Often, the builder will  suggest local retailers or showrooms for clients, and may even accompany them  on their visits to confirm costs and lead times for delivery.</td>

          <p>The  Professional Builder walks a fine line. It is our job to balance a new home's  cost and construction efficiencies while customizing our home design and  specifications. We work closely with our clients to develop the ultimate look  and feel of their new home so that it meets their needs and reflects their  unique taste.</p>
          <p>To that end,  we encourage and enable new-home buyers to select from an increasingly diverse  list of products and finishes before we begin construction. Most often, these  selections are from the catalogs or websites of our trusted suppliers and  feature familiar brand names with rock-solid warranties. This helps us to build  efficiently and keep the budget in check.<br />
            Whenever  necessary, we accommodate a special request from a homebuyer, assuming the  product or system is available and within an agreed budget ... or the budget is  revised to include it.</p>
          <p>This  &quot;customization&quot; process is a two-way street of responsibility and  respect. We rely on our clients to make their selections on time to avoid  delays in delivery and construction.<br />
            We do our  part by establishing deadlines and milestones as part of the construction  agreement. We identify when materials and finishes need to be ordered so they  are on the job site to maintain our construction schedule. Our schedule also  confirms &quot;lead times&quot; -- the time between when a product is ordered  and when the supplier can deliver it -- so that we can coordinate its  installation with the proper contractor.<br />
            Every missed  deadline almost always results in a delay in construction ... which invariably  translates to additional costs. Worse, it can trigger a domino effect,  affecting not just its point in the schedule, but also several others that  follow. Homebuilding is a linear process, often requiring one step to be  finished before another can start; a glitch can therefore ripple through the  schedule, affecting tasks and deadlines that might appear unrelated.</p>
          <p>Over the  years, we've not only come to expand the choices we allow homebuyers to make --  from minor structural changes to any number of finishes -- but also how to  accommodate those choices in the overall scheme and schedule of the project. We  leave plenty of leeway for lead times (especially for new or unfamiliar  selections) and use technology to find reliable sources for special orders.<br />
            Our ultimate  goal is to deliver a satisfying experience and exceed our clients'  expectations. We coach new-home buyers to understand the building process and  the critical role they play in it, and leave ample time to enable comfortable,  unrushed decisions. We are here to advise, offer choices, and ultimately  fulfill dreams -- as well as build homes that will stand the test of time and  evoke memories that span generations.</p>
Warm Regards,<br />
