          <p><em>Q: Where is the most potential to save water inside a home?</em></p>
A: Bathrooms are the best  place to start. Conventional toilets, showers, and faucets combine to consume  an average of 41 gallons per person per day, or about 60 percent of a home's  daily indoor drain, according to the American Water Works Association.  Installing low-flow toilets, showerheads, and faucets can drop daily  consumption by 36 percent, a potential savings of 12,500 gallons of water a  year per household.

          <p class="text">Most  &quot;green building&quot; conversations emphasize energy efficiency. By  contrast, the issue of water -- its scarcity, purity, and significance to  sustainability -- is often overlooked or discounted.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">That's  because in North America, we take water for granted; not only is it cheap, it  is relatively abundant and clean. But while an average bathtub may hold 40  gallons of water, many people in developing countries survive on 8 gallons of  water or less per day. In fact, an estimated 800 million people worldwide lack  access to safe water supplies and 3.5 million people die each year from  water-related disease.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Domestically,  recent seasonal and longer-term droughts in several areas have triggered  restrictions and household quotas on water use. In fact, average residential  water rates have climbed 10 percent nationwide since 2009.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">As a  professional builder who looks out for the welfare of our homebuyers and our  community, we accommodate requests and comply with all building code  requirements to reduce a home's water consumption.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">In many  cases, we can use low-flow plumbing fixtures including toilets, faucets, and  showerheads, to automatically reduce water use without our homeowners noticing  much (if any) difference in their convenience and performance. The latest  clothes washers, dishwashers, and water heating systems also use less water  (and save energy, too). All of those products are readily available and  generally affordable.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">But as much  as these &quot;embedded&quot; water savings reduce consumption, there is more  that we can do. We encourage homeowners to keep their water use in check with some  simple changes to their lifestyle habits.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">One easy way  to save water at home is to limit your showers to no more than 10 minutes and  avoid filling the bathtub unless absolutely necessary. Turn off the bathroom  faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">In addition,  homeowners can save water by running only full loads of laundry and dishes. If  you have to hand-wash some dishes in the kitchen, fill one basin with soapy  water (to clean/scrub) and another with clear water (to rinse) rather than  continuously running the faucet.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">As much as  those lifestyle adjustments can reduce water inside your home, making some  changes outside can be even more impactful. Easy stuff, such as using a broom  instead of a garden hose to clean off your driveway or patio and washing your  car less often (or at a carwash which recycles its water) can save hundreds of  gallons of water a year.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">But the real  culprit of outdoor water waste is landscaping, and especially turf grass areas.  If you can adjust or replace your lawn sprinklers with more targeted, rotating  heads that limit overspray and set up a drip irrigation system for trees and  shrubs, you'll see a significant reduction in your water use.<br />
            With that,  consider putting your irrigation system on a timer and setting it to run in the  early morning to reduce evaporation.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">You can also  buy and install small rainwater catchment systems from a home improvement or  hardware store, which can be used for seasonal flower beds or hanging plants  instead of using potable water for those needs.<br />
            With so many  areas in the developing world so desperate for clean, healthy drinking water,  and our costs continuing to rise, can we afford to take water for granted?</p>
