                  <p><em>Q: What is Lifecycle Assessment?</em></p>
                  <p>A:    Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) is a way to evaluate and estimate the value of a    particular building product or system across its usable life. LCA considers a    product or systemâ€™s cradle-to-grave environmental impact, from its raw    material source to its capacity for recycling and reuse. LCA is a tool for    design and building professionals, providing their clients a better, more    thorough understanding of the materials being used to construct a project.</p></td>

        <td height="1694"><h1>Got  Stuff? Storage Options</h1>
          <p class="text">One of the  by-products of a consumer-based society is that we all collect  &quot;stuff,&quot; from sports equipment and garden tools to holiday  decorations, craft and hobby gear, and clothing. In some cases, people have so  much stuff that it commandeers their closets, outdoor sheds, and garages to the  point of overflow and disorganization.</p>
          <p class="text">Homebuyers  want relief from their storage woes. To that end, a variety of products and  organizational ideas that can add convenient capacity have cropped up for every  nook and cranny of the house.</p>
          <p class="text">Overall, the  most popular trend in storage is the use of modular, adjustable systems that  can easily be manipulated to accommodate changing storage needs. In any storage  setting, be it a garage or a walk-in master suite closet, these systems employ  a simple backbone of tracks or channels secured to the walls on which you can  hang a wide variety of components without any penetrating fasteners.</p>
          <p class="text">In a clothes  closet, for example, the system can include open shelves, door and drawer  cabinets, tilted shoe racks, hanger poles, hooks, and laundry hampers. These  pieces and parts can be arranged based on a homeowner's particular needs; as  those needs change, the components can be moved, replaced, or supplemented.</p>
          <p class="text">The garage  is another area well suited to these storage systems. There are now wall-hung  cabinets, shelving, hooks, and other handy components with the ability to be  moved to any point along tracks or channels secured to the wall. Garage storage  systems feature cabinets and work surfaces with lock-in-place castors that  allow owners to easily bring those elements out into the open, or even to the  outside, for better, safer, and more convenient access to their  &quot;stuff.&quot;<br />
            In both of  these settings, the storage system typically raises the wall-hung components  above the floor, making it easier to vacuum the carpet or sweep out the garage.  Doing so reduces the perception (or reality) of clutter.</p>
          <p class="text">In the  kitchen, cabinet and appliance manufacturers offer several options to increase  storage capacity. In addition to handy drop-down drawers and roll-out shelves,  many of the latest cabinet companies provide in-drawer organizers, dedicated  trash and recycling bins, and adjustable shelving to suit a variety of needs.</p>
          <p class="text">In the  laundry room, pedestal drawers set underneath the washer and dryer provide  additional and convenient storage while raising the height of the washer and  dryer, making them easier to use, as well.</p>
          <p class="text">Today's  modular storage systems are available in a wide variety of styles and price  points, from luxurious, all-wood components that enhance any master suite to  ventilated coated wire sections that make sense for kids' rooms and utility  areas. Even if there is enough land and ample budget to build a large house  with plenty of closets and space for stuff, it's only smart to make those  areas, and the entire house, as space-efficient and valuable as possible.</p>
