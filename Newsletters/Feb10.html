<p><em>Q: What is a compact fluorescent light bulb?</em></p>
A: Compact fluorescent  lights (CFLs) are a type of lamp that fits into a standard light bulb socket.  Advanced CFLs feature electronic instead of magnetic ballasts to eliminate most  of the flickering and slow activation commonly associated with fluorescent  lighting. Compared to incandescent bulbs, CFLs have a longer rated life (up to  15 times longer) and use less electricity.</td>

        <td><p class="header2">New Technologies Light the Way</p>
          <p class="text">Remember the  old center-of-the-ceiling light fixture? You entered a room, hit the wall  switch, and a couple of light bulbs behind a semi-transparent plate shed  general, flat light over the whole room. All features of the room, good and  bad, got the same emphasis. There was enough light to avoid tripping over the  dog, but not enough light to read by.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Things have  changed. Lighting is now a sophisticated design element of the modern home,  whether that home is traditional or contemporary in style. Every aspect of  lighting -- placement, function, control, style, energy-efficiency -- has  evolved to offer exactly what is needed in each room.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">The  thoughtful placement of lighting fixtures with specific function can make a  dramatic change in a room. For example, instead of a big overhead fluorescent  panel, new kitchens now feature task-specific fixtures such as recessed spot  lights over the sink and other work stations, strip lights under wall cabinets,  or dropped fixtures over work islands or eating areas. Other examples of task  lighting include automatic bulbs in cabinets and pantries, up- and down-lights  that showcase landscaping or artwork, and fixtures positioned to throw light on  stair treads.</p>
          <p class="text">Lighting  controls have also come a long way from the simple wall-mounted switch. Homeowners  can program or manipulate lighting schemes to create custom ambiance for a  casual dinner party or an intimate evening at home. Timers, remote controls,  dimmer switches, and motion sensors enhance the flexibility, beauty and  convenience of a lighting design using both wired and wireless technologies.<br />
            Besides  increasing the technical sophistication of their products, lighting  manufacturers have had to keep up with current styles and fashions. Pendants,  wall sconces, chandeliers, and domed fixtures are available in an almost  endless array of styles and finishes. In addition, lighting suppliers have  developed a greater range of compatible fixtures to achieve a coordinated look  for all lighting products in the house.<br />
            Security lighting  has also grown in popularity in recent years. Inside the home, high tech wired  and wireless timers can be programmed to create the illusion of activity while  the owners are away. Outside, motion-activated lighting is a basic feature,  especially at entries. Outdoor fixtures can highlight house numbers to assist  emergency services. Lights in the garage and house can flash on and off as part  of a security system that alerts neighbors or police of an unauthorized  intrusion.<br />
            Outdoor  light fixtures are increasingly powered by solar energy and light sensors to  save even more electricity. Small photovoltaic cells are built right into path  and landscape products to power them only at night. These systems require no  wiring or current from another source, making them safe and easy to replace as  needed. Homeowners enjoy the added convenience and beauty of outdoor lighting,  whether or not they remember to turn them on or off.<br />
            Professional  builders incorporate modern lighting design and products in their new homes,  adding long-lasting value while enhancing style, convenience, comfort,  security, and efficiency.</p>
