  <strong>Building</strong><strong><br />
  <strong>Success 101 </strong></strong> <br />
  <em>Q: Should I have an architect help me select my builder?</em></p>
A: If you have already  engaged an architect to draw the plans for your house, by all means ask that  person to suggest possible candidates and to join you in interviewing builders;  most know and have worked with local builders in the past who might be a good  match. However, it's often best to find a builder first, essentially to work  with a design professional to help ensure that your budget is considered  through the design process. It's heartbreaking (and leaves a bad taste) to  invest time, effort, and money into architectural drawings that you find out  later -- from your builder -- are too expensive to build. Better to have the  whole team together from the start.</td>

        <td height="1694"><p><strong>Finding the Right Builder </strong> <br />
            <span class="text">There is a  ton of information about how to find a builder for your new home. This  newsletter, in fact, is one way we use to impart information about our company  in hopes of being a good match for your project.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Unfortunately,  most of what you read or hear from non-builder &quot;experts&quot; reduces the  decision to numbers, specifically the cost estimates that a few builders  provide in a competitive bidding process. To us, basing such an important  decision and arguably one of the largest investments of your life on mere numbers  is at least incomplete and at worst, a potential nightmare scenario. Frankly,  we'd rather not be your builder if your evaluation of our capabilities rests  entirely on how much we think it will cost to build your new home.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Instead, we  encourage and have found success (read: satisfied clients) by suggesting a  different tact. It's a comprehensive approach that admittedly takes a little  more time than just collecting bids, but one that can result in truly finding  the right builder for your unique situation and budget.<br />
            It starts  with identifying what's &quot;right&quot; for you, a unique definition that  requires a solid vision for your project and some personal introspection. For  instance, if you are planning to build a large custom home, you should look at  builders in your area that specialize in and have a track record of building  those types of homes.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Narrow that  list by investigating each builder's website, calling their references,&nbsp;or  your local builders association.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Based on  your current personal and professional relationships, consider the types of  personalities you like and respond to best. You'll probably spend more time  with your builder over the next several months than almost anyone else.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">You won't  know if you're 'compatible' until you meet face-to-face. If you're confident in  one builder, either from your research or a strong referral, you may not feel  the need to meet with any other candidates. But if you are truly starting your  search from scratch, without a referral from a trusted source, we suggest you  develop a short list of 3-4 builders and invite them to make a presentation in  your home or their office -- as much to glean their methods as to gauge  compatibility.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">At those  meetings, be open and honest about your project. If you have a set of  architectural plans, show them. Request that each candidate bring photos of  projects that are similar to yours in style and size. Inquire about how they  define &quot;quality&quot; construction and how comfortable they are about  green building ... if that's something you care about.<br />
            Finally, ask  the builder (or builders) about their financial stability and, in turn, share  your project budget and financial plan. There's no sense in trying to forge a  good working relationship if you demand a builder's financial status but won't  be forthcoming about what you can afford and how you'll pay for your new home.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Once you  find a builder that's earned your confidence in their skills, financial  stability, understanding of your project, and (most important) their ability to  communicate with you, it's time to refine and sign a contract and get your  builder involved in the project as soon as possible. Having a builder on the  team early helps ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction and  toward the same goal of realizing the home you envision.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Warm Regards,</span><br />
