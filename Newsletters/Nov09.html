<strong>Success 101 </strong></strong> <br />
<em>Q: What is &quot;zoned&quot; heating and cooling? </em></p>
A: As a way to lower energy  costs and enable a more comfortable and healthier indoor living spaces,  builders separate areas of a home into smaller zones rather than one big space  to heat and cool. In this scheme, smaller, more efficient heating and cooling  equipment (furnaces, air conditioners, etc.) are responsible for smaller zones  within the house; the warm or cool air generated by the equipment is  distributed through metal ducts (or chases) only to its designated zone, thus  reducing energy use and enabling more control over temperature and comfort in  different areas of the house.</td>

            </p>
          <p class="text">We see it  every day...<br />
</p>
          <p class="text">No sooner  does a client take ownership of their new home, their out-of-town friends and  relatives are anxious to visit and share in their excitement and pride. In  today's higher-end homes, these guests may also be pleasantly surprised by  their accommodations. Guest rooms are no longer limited to a den with a sleeper-sofa,  a spare kids room upstairs, or a nearly finished attic or basement.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">The boom of  bounce-back children, in-laws, and out-of-town guests has created a generation  of visitors who are more likely to stay longer and require ample space in the  home for a comfortable visit. As a result, guest suites - complete with a full  bath and other amenities - are moving into the mainstream of new-home design.  In these homes, guests receive the royal treatment.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">The latest  (and greatest) version of the guest bedroom is a private suite. Luxury suites  can come complete with a separate bathroom, away from the family's bedrooms and  in close proximity to public spaces, such as the kitchen. Many are accessed by  a vestibule or short hallway to create privacy. Private courtyards or  balconies, or at least exclusive access to a pool or outdoor eating area, are  fast becoming expected (and appreciated) features, as well.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">In addition,  the guest suite may also have its own heating and cooling system, or at least a  branch of the home's main system controlled by guests on a separate thermostat.  This provides maximum personal comfort without affecting the rest of the house.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">In some  cases, guest suites offer separate, private entrances. For guests or an  adult-child living at home, a separate entry allows them to come and go without  disturbing the rest of the family in the main living areas. Concealed from view  and located on a side or rear elevation to maintain security, private entrances  are a convenient perk for guests, live-in caretakers, or family members  occupying the suite.<br />
          </p>
          <p class="text">Today's  guest suites can be designed to rival the master suite in luxurious finishes,  if not in square footage. For many of our clients, a regular, year-round flow  of short-term guests is commonplace. Homebuyers in need of dedicated guest  quarters appreciate the accommodation of space, comfort, and privacy afforded  by guest suites in today's upscale new homes.</p>
          <p class="text">Warm Regards,</p>
          <p><span class="text"><br />
