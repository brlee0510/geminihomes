              <strong>Success 101 </strong></strong> <br />
              <em>Q: What's the difference between engineered wood flooring and  solid wood flooring?</em></p>
A: Unlike solid wood  planks, engineered wood flooring features a substrate (or main section) made  from thin sections of solid wood that are set in a cross-hatched pattern and  laminated together. A thin veneer of solid wood (oak, maple, etc.) on top of  the substrate provides the appearance of a solid wood floor. Because of its  substrate, engineered wood flooring does not react as dramatically to changes  in temperature or humidity, and requires less maintenance than solid wood.</td>

          <p><br />
            <span class="text">You may have  heard the term &quot;customization&quot; in your research for your new home.  It's a word that's typically used to describe the process of making alterations  to the floor plan or exterior appearance of a home so that it reflects your  particular tastes, current lifestyle, and location.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">But there's  a more subtle yet equally important variation on that term that's emerging  within the home design and building communities. Simply, that new homes today  are -- by design -- better able to adapt to the changing needs of their owners  after they've moved in and for years to come.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">This kind of  customization has its roots in areas like the Great Room and so-called  &quot;flex&quot; spaces that many builders offer these days. But true  customization requires a more thoughtful approach to the floor plan, materials  choices, and future lifestyle changes than simply a room or two that allow some  flexibility in their use.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Obviously,  rooms like the kitchen and bathrooms are dedicated spaces. But there's no  reason that a dining room can't eventually become a home office, then switch  back or become something else down the road, depending on what the family wants  and needs.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">More dramatically,  consider a back room -- properly designed -- that could eventually evolve from  a simple bedroom into a family or TV room, a home office, a rental apartment,  or a first-floor master suite as the owners age and tire of climbing stairs to  their bedroom.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Similarly, a  seasonal or long-term storage area adjacent to a second-floor master suite  could, over time and if properly designed, become another bedroom or swap with  the master bedroom, leaving the former as an upstairs family room or office;  the space could also become a private sitting room or home gym for the owners.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">These  examples are not only practical, but generally inexpensive to provide ... if  your builder has the forethought to &quot;rough in&quot; plumbing and other  mechanical systems. This level of customization could set the stage for a small  kitchen and a private entry to serve as a future rental apartment. Another  option: leave sufficient room for a staircase or design the roof frame to  accommodate skylights or dormer windows to finish an upstairs area adjacent to  the master suite.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">The benefits  of being able to &quot;customize&quot; a home you already live in are  inspiring. As much as we want to build new homes (it is our business, after  all), we also like the concept of creating communities of people that are able  to live in their homes longer and build tight neighborhood bonds -- which  proper design and planning allows.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">We also like  providing homes that serve our clients now and in the future, reducing their  on-going maintenance and extensive remodeling costs. This type of 'built-in'  flexibility also helps make the house easier to sell when the owners are ready  to move on to another new home.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Finally,  given the current economy and changes in construction and mortgage lending that  has limited the ability to buy and sell homes quickly, we recognize and respect  that families are looking for homes that they can enjoy over a longer period of  time.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">This kind of  &quot;customization&quot; works best in new homes. As builders, we can direct  the floor plan and construction process from the beginning to accommodate your  family's changing lifestyle needs. </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Warm Regards,</span><br />
