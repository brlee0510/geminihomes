          <p><em>Q: What is a cool roof?</em></p>
A: A cool roof is a  combination of a reflective roof surface (usually a lighter-colored shingle)  that is held slightly above the roof deck (or sheathing) to allow passive air  ventilation underneath the shingles; a cool roof system also may include the  application of insulation in the roof rafter cavities. The goal is to keep the  roof surface from becoming excessively hot and transferring that heat to the  attic or conditioned living spaces, thus reducing the burden on the homeâ€™s  cooling system and energy use.

        <td height="1694" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><h1>Insulation:  Stay Cool without Sweating Energy Bills </h1>
          <p>New homes  are built to save energy, and a primary component of that goal is insulation. The  definition of insulation, however, is rapidly expanding as homebuyers and  energy codes demand even better energy-use performance from new homes.<br />
            </p>
          <p>Today, there  are far more options than those rolls of fiberglass you see on the shelves of  big-box home improvement stores. While &quot;batt&quot; insulation remains an  inexpensive yet effective option, other materials have emerged that help  optimize thermal value in new structures or when replacing conventional  insulation.<br />
          </p>
          <p>For  instance, in addition to insulating between the wall studs, we may add a  1/2-inch thick rigid foam insulation panel behind the finish siding of a new  home. That technique is commonly called a thermal break, and many of the latest  energy codes and standards, such as the federal Energy Star program, require  it.<br />
          </p>
          <p>In addition  to taping the joints between the insulation panels, a thin, woven air-water  barrier (also called a weather-resistant barrier or housewrap) can be applied  over the panels to shed incidental water that gets behind the siding or stucco  and blocks air infiltration through the structure.<br />
          </p>
          <p>Another  increasingly popular insulating technique is called &quot;flash-and-batt,&quot;  a practice that combines conventional fiberglass batts with a &quot;flash&quot;  or thin layer of expanding foam insulation.<br />
          </p>
          <p>Specifically,  an insulation contractor will first spray-apply a 1-inch deep layer of foam  layer into a wall cavity. As the foam expands, it seals any gaps in the cavity  to block air and moisture vapor from flowing through the wall. The contractor  then fills the rest of the cavity with uncompressed fiberglass to resist  thermal (or heat) transfer. The result is an air-tight and well-insulated wall.<br />
          </p>
          <p>Most of a  home's energy is lost through the attic or roof structure. The difference in  air temperature and pressure between the attic and the living space below can  be dramatic. This causes air to escape into the attic and puts an extra burden  to maintain a desired temperature on the home's heating and cooling system.<br />
          </p>
          <p>A  flash-and-batt application can almost entirely eliminate thermal loss into the  attic. Often, after the flash layer is applied within the floor cavities, a  loose-fill fiberglass or cellulose (made from recycled newspaper and similar  fibers) effectively covers the floor.<br />
          </p>
          <p>Another  option is to apply an air-tight version of spray-foam insulation to the roof  rafter cavities to block air and heat from entering the attic space. The result  is what is often called a &quot;semi-conditioned&quot; attic because the air  temperature of the attic and living spaces below is almost the same, but  without actually having to heat or cool the attic space.<br />
          </p>
          <p>The push to  make new homes more energy efficient is driving new and better insulation  products and applications, and professional builders are at the forefront of  keeping up with that evolution to provide better indoor comfort and help reduce  monthly energy bills.</p>
Warm Regards,<br />
