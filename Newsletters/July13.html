                                          <p>A:  While&nbsp;most jurisdictions require a building permit for structural work,  whether it's a new home or a remodel, others require a permit for every job,  and still others set their requirements somewhere in the middle. As for codes,  while the International Code Council publishes a model building code, states  can choose to adopt all, part, or none of it, which means that codes vary  considerably from one jurisdiction to another. The differences are driven by  factors that range from politics to local conditions. As a professional builder  it is our business to know our local permit and building code requirements.</p></td>

                                    <h1>Eliminate  Surprises by Clearly Defining the Job </h1>
                                    <p>Building a  new home is one of the most important investments a family will make. In many  cases it represents the single largest financial investment. The home is  designed and built to provide years of pleasure, comfort, and security. It is  the physical manifestation of &quot;family&quot; and the place where  celebration and joy are expressed and experienced.<br />
                                      </p>
                                    <p>No wonder  that when it comes to building a home, no one likes surprises. The document  that spells out the detail and helps sets expectations for both builder and client  is the contract. The contract is the roadmap that defines the destination,  describes the detail of how the project will proceed, and steers everyone clear  of obstructions and delays.<br />
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The contract  is crafted so that it protects both builder and client, and clarifies  everything about the job. It is organized into a number of sections, including  information about the project location (address, lot number, etc.), permits,  contractor insurance and licensing, project timetables, and payment schedules.<br />
                                    </p>
                                    <p>While all of  these details are important, most builders find that if conflicts arise during  construction, they're usually caused by misunderstanding over the &quot;who,  what, and how&quot; of the job, and an effective contract works to clarify  these issues.<br />
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Who makes  the decisions?<br />
                                    </h3>
                                    <p>One very  short but important section names the owners' representative. This should be  one person -- for instance the husband or wife, but not both -- who will act as  the builder's main contact for approvals, changes, and questions. Having one  owner as the representative helps eliminate confusion and makes communication  more efficient. Similarly, the language should define who on the builder's team  can sign off on changes -- whether it's the company owner or the owner plus the  site manager or superintendent.<br />
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>What,  exactly, is the client buying?<br />
                                    </h3>
                                    <p>The project  description defines exactly what the homeowners will be getting for their  investment. The more detail the better. Most contracts accomplish this by  referencing the project plans and specifications.<br />
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The plans  are the visual description of the new home, and include floor plans, elevation  drawings, and all electrical and mechanical systems. They should note who  prepared them and when they were signed. The plans should include all necessary  changes -- for instance, from the building department and the zoning board.<br />
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The  specifications, or &quot;specs,&quot; are the written description of what will  be done. They list all items that will be installed in the home: the carpet,  flooring, door hardware and light fixtures in each room; the kitchen  appliances, furnaces, and water heaters; the brands and colors of paint and  roof shingles. The project price is based in part on the specs, so clients  should study these carefully to confirm that they understand what they are  getting before signing the contract.<br />
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>How will  discretionary funds be allocated?<br />
                                    </h3>
                                    <p>Discretionary  funds include allowances and change orders. It's important both be crystal  clear. Allowances cover parts of the job that haven't been fully specified yet,  such as when the homeowner has yet to decide on types of flooring or faucet  fixtures. The allowance should specify when the decision is needed.<br />
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The contract  should also clearly explain the builder's change-order policy, including what  types of changes can be made at each stage of the project, who can sign off on  changes (the owner and builder reps), and the administrative cost for preparing  change orders. It's in everyone's interest for even small changes to be  documented in writing.<br />
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A contract  that clearly defines the who, what, and how of the job steers the project clear  of the most common minefields. This will help ensure that the homeowners get  the home they want, on the timetable and for the price they were expecting.</p>
