          <strong>Success 101 </strong></strong></p>
<p><em>Q: What is  net-zero energy?</em></p>
A: A net-zero energy  balance is achieved when a home produces as much energy as it consumes over the  course of a 12-month period. Though a challenge to accomplish, and almost  always requiring some sort of on-site energy generation system (e.g., solar  roof panels), achieving a net-zero energy balance isn't as unrealistic -- or as  expensive -- as it was just 5 years ago.</td>

              <strong>Earlier is Better </strong></strong> <br />
              <span class="text">Historically and  traditionally, people have been conditioned to follow a certain, linear path to  building a new home. That is, hire an architect or designer to create the  plans, select a builder and then maybe bring in a stylist or interior designer  to apply the finishing touches.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">But the reality is that this  step-by-step approach to getting a new house is not only outdated, but can be  risky in terms of cost and quality. A better approach is to form your project  team from the outset. Doing so fosters a cooperative rather than combative or  competitive working environment that produces more satisfying results. It's  also a dynamic that's more likely to ensure you'll get what you want in a new home  at the price you can afford.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">By bringing your design and  building professionals together as soon as possible, they can dedicate their  efforts to meeting your needs and looking out for your budget.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Selecting a professional  builder at the outset of your new-home project allows that person or company to  work with an architect or designer to deliver plans and specifications that are  realistic and can actually be built. It also increases the likelihood that the  project will come in on time and on budget.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Too often, the old approach  left builders having to argue changes to the plans and specifications that  sometimes compromised a home's aesthetic value, if only to make it affordable.  Downsizing is difficult. No one wants to be disappointed or feel like they had  to sacrifice something -- especially a favorite feature or product -- because  it was discovered to be too pricey.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">This is much less likely to  happen when architect and builder are working together early in the process. By  combining their expertise they can help ensure that what's drawn can be built  without sacrificing design quality and staying within budget. This  collaboration can result in a far better housing value.<br />
            Here are some additional  reasons to hire a builder from the beginning:</span></p>
          <p><span class="text"><strong>Materials ordering.</strong> Some products and materials require  long lead times -- perhaps months -- between order and delivery. A professional  builder can identify these situations and be able to place an order so that  product delivery will not delay the construction schedule.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text"><strong>Code compliance.</strong> More so than design professionals,  builders know the applicable building codes as interpreted by the local  authority and inspectors. They can help insure that plans will be approved for  a permit the first time they are submitted. When plans are kicked back for  changes, a home start can be delayed, or worse, a job may be stopped midway to  address a code issue.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">A professional builder also  will know when and how to submit for a building permit and schedule necessary  inspections during construction to establish and maintain a tight building  schedule from the beginning.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text"><strong>Buildablity.</strong> You can draw anything, but even  something as seemingly simple as a window or door needs to be installed  properly. If allowed to be part of your new home's planning process,  professional builders and their subcontractors can quickly and easily identify  potential installation issues before they become costly problems on the job  site.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">A collaborative effort from  the outset allows ideas and information to flow among your design professional,  builder, stylist, and you before anyone commits a significant amount of time  and money to your new house. Sharing ideas and alternatives to achieve the best  result is a far better approach than discovering a better idea too late, or not  at all.</span></p>
          <p class="text">Warm Regards,<br />
