                    <em>Q:      Where can I learn more about universal design?</em> <br />
            A: There      are increasing numbers of information resources about universal (or      accessible) design for residential settings. A good place to begin is with      the <a href="http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/" target="_blank">Center for      Universal Design</a> in Raleigh, N.C. Another is on the NAHB website. Go to <a href="http://www.nahbrc.org" target="_blank">www.nahbrc.org</a> and type      in 'LifeWise Home Project' in the search area.</span></p></td>

              <p class="style1"><strong class="header2">Bath Trends: The Royal Treatment </strong> <br />
                <span class="text">How far      the bathroom has come in housing history, from an unheated shack outside to      a treasured private retreat. Sure, the basic functions of a bathroom are      intact and in place, but in today's master suites, especially, the space      has evolved to include a variety of spa-like amenities and luxury features.<br />
                </span></p>
              <p class="text">As in      the kitchen (the other &quot;hot button&quot; room of any house), design      professionals and product manufacturers have focused their efforts on the      bathroom with an increasing variety of styles, finishes, and features.      Consider these current bath trends:<br />
                </p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Shower      Power: </strong>Forget      about a single showerhead hung from the wall. Today's showers offer      multiple, adjustable heads on every wall and from above, with wall-mounted      control pads to set and manipulate spray patterns, intensity, and      temperature. Some heads, called shower tiles, are set flush to the wall or      ceiling to provide a gentle spray, while handheld shower wands allow users      the ultimate in water control.<br />
                </p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Tub      Time: </strong>Bathtubs      are not only getting longer and deeper, and with requisite whirlpool jets,      but also can include mood lighting and spillover troughs to create a more      relaxing experience. Called &quot;chromatherapy&quot; by one plumbing      manufacturer, these tubs feature underwater LED lights that gently change      color across a wide spectrum of soft pastels; effervescent bubbling action      from multiple underwater ports enhances the soothing effect. Meanwhile,      overflow tubs enable a deeper soaking experience without the worry of      making a mess.<br />
                </p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Wellness      Centers: </strong>In      addition to featuring luxury items, bathrooms (especially master baths) are      getting larger -- large enough, in some cases, to include in-home spa      amenities including massage tables and yoga or dance studios that offer      more convenience, privacy, and cleanliness.<br />
                </p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Clothes      Care: </strong>Along      the same lines as the in-home spa and studio concept is the idea of a      home-based laundry center, including personal dry-cleaners and closet-like      clothes fresheners and flat-rack dryers in addition to traditional laundry      equipment. If the bathroom has the footage, why not install such products      to make life easier, cut down on errands, and save a bit of money while      attaining a higher level of quality care for your clothes?<br />
                </p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Personal      Service: </strong>Master      bathrooms have become destinations. As such, they need additional      conveniences, including laundry and clothes storage as well as a place to      prepare snacks and refreshments. Often called &quot;morning kitchens,&quot;      these mini-service areas offer built-in coffee and espresso makers, compact      refrigerators, bar sinks, microwave ovens, and perhaps undercounter      dishwasher drawers (not to mention adequate cabinet storage) to privately      serve the owners as they get ready for work in the morning or wind down at      the end of the day. <br />
                </p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Universal      Access: </strong>Whether      to accommodate a temporary injury, a more chronic disability, a young      child, or an elderly relative or guest, the concept of universal or      accessible design can be easily and affordably achieved in any bathroom      without sacrificing style or luxury. Multiple-height vanities,      lever-handled faucets, D-shaped cabinet pulls, and zero-threshold showers      with built-in seating and handheld heads are just a few design and product      ideas that support universal design.<br />
                Warm      Regards,<br />
