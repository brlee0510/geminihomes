            <em>Q: What is an &quot;infinity-edge&quot; pool?</em></p>
A: An infinity or  disappearing edge pool is one in which the water at one end appears to  &quot;drop off&quot; into nothing, without a border. In fact, that's exactly  what's happening. Along that edge, the pool water spills into a trough, from  which it is filtered and recycled back into the pool. The look is very sleek  and contemporary, especially if you are fortunate enough to have a back yard  that overlooks a desirable, natural view.</td>

        <td><p><strong class="header"><span class="header2">Backyard as Destination Resort </span></strong> <br />
            </p>
          <p><span class="text">Most of us  have fond memories of family barbecues in the back yard or running through the  sprinklers. Only the clairvoyant among us could have imagined the new 'back  yards': the highly appointed outdoor spaces that are becoming increasingly  popular in today's new homes.<br />
            Long gone  are the days of the patio slab, rectangular swimming pool, and rolling kettle  grill. Current outdoor living features and materials are just as stylish and  creative as the homes they serve, providing multifunctional destinations for  owners and guests.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Professional  designs ensure a smooth transition to and from the indoors, provide artful  square footage, and the proper utility connections for all of the desired  features. Careful planning can even accommodate year-round enjoyment through  creative options for shade, sun, and other weather conditions.<br />
            One of the  primary requests for outdoor space is a fully functional kitchen. A built-in,  gas-powered barbecue grill, complete with warming drawers, heating elements and  plenty of grilling surface, is essential equipment for today's outdoor chef.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Because an  outdoor kitchen is often designed within a covered patio or veranda, grills are  usually supplemented with a ventilation system to exhaust smoke and odors.  Other conveniences include a sink and faucet, an under-counter refrigerator/ice  maker, and a row of base cabinets topped by a weather-tough countertop.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">An outdoor  kitchen logically demands an outdoor eating area. Weather-resistant furnishings  and upholstery are available in an increasingly wide range of styles to suit  any taste and need, from formal dining tables to casual, plushy seating  options. Outdoor rooms might also include a bar island between the cooking and  eating areas. Such islands double as serving areas for casual meals.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Another  popular feature of outdoor rooms is a fireplace-television combination. Modern  gas-powered fireplaces are designed to simulate authentic wood-burning units,  but with better energy use, heat distribution, and ventilation. Such chimneys  can accommodate a niche for a flat-screen television, easily supplemented by  small, outdoor-rated speakers for surround-sound. &nbsp;What used to be a plain  patio has now become an enviable destination for family and guests.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">To make the  space accessible to the indoors and to merge indoor and outdoor entertainment  space, many designs feature all-glass folding or pocket doors that create  wide-open passages. When designed with the home's micro-climate in mind, these  doors may also help to cool the house with natural breezes. Ceiling fans keep  the air moving through the outdoor room, while outdoor-rated lights in the  ceiling and on the walls allow its use after dark.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">To keep  less-desirable weather out of both the house and the covered outdoor space,  motorized roll-down screens -- ideally concealed in the structure -- keep  pests, winds, rain, and other debris out. Such screens come in a variety of  weights and are easily controlled by a remote device or wall switch.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">The living  space extends beyond the covered area, of course. Patios can be equipped with interlocking  pavers, flagstones, or stamped or colored concrete to add dimension and  interest. The open-air space might be a deck, increasingly finished with  weather-resistant engineered planks that require little maintenance, maintain  their color and structural integrity, and are eco-friendly. To complete the  look, consider adding comfortable built-in seating and a freestanding fire pit.<br />
            Finally,  modern pools and spas, are becoming works of art, incorporating fountains and  waterfalls, rock formations, frameless edges, and other landscaping features.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Combined, a  covered outdoor room, open deck or patio, and pool/spa feature create a  value-added feature for any new home. By extending the living space with  year-round options to enjoy it, the modern back yard provides years of  enjoyment and boosts property value for any homeowner.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">The old  backyard has become a destination resort.</span><span class="text"><br />
