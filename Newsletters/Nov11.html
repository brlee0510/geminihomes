              <p><em>Q: What's the most common job site safety hazard?</em><br />
                A:    In residential construction, the most common hazards relate to falls, namely    from roofs or areas that are more than six feet above the ground. OSHA    reports that scaffolding, fall prevention, and ladders are among its top 5    most-frequently cited violations. They recently tightened standards to    further mitigate those hazards.</p></td>

      <tr>
        <td height="1694"><h1>Safety  First</h1>
          <p class="text">There's no  getting around it: construction can be a hazardous job. We say &quot;can  be&quot; because professional builders respect those hazards and equip and  train their workers and subcontractors to mitigate safety issues as much as  possible. By doing so, professional builders protect their businesses and their  clients from liability.</p>
          <p class="text">The federal  Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA) provides specific  guidelines and regulations for homebuilders and contractors regarding the  prevention of accidents on a residential job site. The penalties for failing to  comply with those rules range from hefty fines to shutting down the job until  violations are corrected.</p>
          <p class="text">Professional  builders not only comply with those regulations, but also often take extra  steps to help ensure a safe working environment on every project, and to help  keep everyone out of harm's way.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Inspection.</strong> As directed by OSHA,  professional builders continually inspect their job sites for potential  hazards, and may even have a safety manager that regularly visits each site.  Common hazards may include ladders or scaffolding that are unsecured or set on  uneven ground, unmarked trenches, or an incomplete or missing first aid kit.</p>
          <p class="text">If  violations are found, they are quickly reported and remedied to get the company  back into compliance. And, they are corrected for the next job.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Education  and Training.</strong> It is critical to continually educate workers, to train and equip them to  recognize and avoid construction job site hazards and accidents.</p>
          <p class="text">In addition  to a written safety and health program required by OSHA, professional builders  often conduct what's called &quot;Toolbox Talks&quot; on the subject of safety,  perhaps showing a video, presenting a report, or (even better) showing workers  a real-world example of a common hazard and how to remedy or avoid it.</p>
          <p class="text">Builders who  are dedicated to safety also equip their crews with the latest in safety gear,  from guardrails on ladders and scaffolding to hard hats, gloves, eye  protection, and personal harnesses -- and keep that gear in optimum working  order. These builders also require their trade partners to follow these same  safety procedures with their employees.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Incentives.</strong> Smart builders often  use incentives to help ensure safety. A worker who reports or remedies a job  site hazard may earn a bonus, time off, or some other reward that recognizes  his or her initiative and sets an example for the rest of the crew.<br />
            Builders may  also track and publicly post job site safety achievements, such as the number  of days without an accident or time lost to a job site injury. Those  accomplishments may earn the company recognition from OSHA or acknowledgement  from the company that insures the builder against liability and worker's  compensation -- lowering the builder's overhead costs and enabling them to be  more competitive for future jobs.</p>
          <p class="text"><br />
            <strong>Including  Owners.</strong> Savvy and safety-conscious builders know that their homeowner clients will want  to occasionally visit the job site to see progress, make decisions and discuss  concerns. Safety is no less a priority for those instances.</p>
          <p class="text">Homebuyers can go a long way to keeping  themselves safe on the job site by following the same rules and procedures as  the crew. We encourage them to wear hard hats and safety goggles and avoid  visiting and walking through a house under construction without supervision,  after hours, and on weekends, as they may not be aware or are unprepared to  avoid hazards. </p>
