<em>Q: What is a lien release?</em></p>
A: A lien release is a  document that confirms that a contractor or subcontractor (such as an  electrician) has been paid in full for the work he was hired to do on your  house. By providing a lien release to you or your remodeling contractor (who  often collects releases from all subs and suppliers upon completion of the  project or each phase of the job), the electrician gives up any legal rights to  request more money; in return, it is agreed that his scope of work has been  completed to your satisfaction and that you cannot request more work be done  within the original contract agreement.</td>

        <td height="2053"><p><strong>Preparing for a Room Addition </strong> <br />
            <span class="text">The kids are  getting older (and bigger) and your house seems to be shrinking. You want to  work at home, but there's no place to get enough privacy. You love to  entertain, but your house just isn't laid out for it. You've decided to welcome  an elderly parent to live with you, but all the bedrooms are upstairs ... and  occupied.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">These are  just some of the realities of modern life that drive some of our clients to  consider and eventually add space to their homes. To find out if you're  destined for a room addition, even before you call a professional remodeler,  consider these preliminary planning steps:</span></p>
          <p><strong>What  do you need?</strong><span class="text"> A room addition is a big remodeling project, so it should have a purpose that  truly solves a need that no other remodeling option can address. Figuring out  that need (or needs) will go a long way toward determining the size, location,  and overall scope of the addition.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">For  instance, the need for a home office -- driven by a telecommuting or  self-employment opportunity -- generally means a smaller addition in an out-of-the-way  location for privacy.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">A family  entertainment area, by contrast, will likely be a large, open space and easily  accessible from the other main living areas of the house, such as the kitchen;  it may also be best served by a half-bath and offer access to the outdoors.</span></p>
          <p><strong>What  do you like?</strong> W<span class="text">e recommend that our clients take time to create a &quot;catalog&quot; of  photos and articles from magazines and newspapers that illustrate their tastes.  For a professional remodeler, it is a valuable tool to creating and delivering  a truly successful and satisfying addition. </span></p>
          <p><strong>Check  with the neighbors.</strong> Y<span class="text">our goal for a room addition should be to bring your  current house up to or maybe just beyond the value and features of your  immediate neighborhood. Take a two-block tour of the homes around your house to  get a sense of the standard in terms of size and assumed interior spaces; if it  looks like someone has added on recently, ask them a few questions about that  experience.<br />
              It's also  important to get educated about any codes, covenants, and restrictions  (CC&amp;Rs) imposed by your neighborhood or homeowner's association, if one  exists. CC&amp;Rs usually regulate allowable setbacks (the distance between  homes and the street), building height, style, and color. They can limit the proportion  of built structures to total lot size, define allowable landscape features and  detail acceptable changes. CC&amp;R rules may even trump codes enforced by the  city.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Stay  in character.</strong> <span class="text">As a professional remodeling contractor, our goal is to make room additions a seamless  part of your existing house, as if it the new section was there all along. For  any addition, we look for ways to extend or match your home's original roof  forms, exterior materials and features (such as siding, windows, and trim  accents), and proportion.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Money  matters.</strong> <span class="text">Before you contact a remodeling contractor, decide how much you can afford for  a room addition and where you'll get the money to build it.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">We typically  advise our clients to determine&nbsp; and express a budget in monthly terms,  like a mortgage or car payment, to get the clearest idea of how it will impact  their daily lives and overall, on-going expenses.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Figuring out  a budget also includes financing, either from savings, a loan, a gift, or some  other source (or combination of funding sources). Once you have confidence that  you can afford and fund a room addition, share your budget with your chosen  contractor to make sure the project is designed and built within that dollar  amount.</span></p>
