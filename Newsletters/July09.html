          <strong>Building<br />
            <strong>Success 101 </strong></strong> <br />
            <em>Q: My builder seems somewhat removed from the day-to-day construction      process and I deal mostly with the site superintendent. Is that normal?</em> <br />
          A: Increasingly, today's builders rely on others both inside      and outside the company to actually build a house. Your home is more than      'sticks and bricks'. Builders must also coordinate a vast behind the scenes      network of trade partners and vendors to keep production on time and on      budget. Successful companies find it advantageous to assign a home's      construction to a superintendent, whose job it is to keep their customers informed,      facilitate changes, and manage the day-to-day happenings on the job site. </span></span></p></td>

        <td><p><strong class="header2">What Can Your Builder Control? </strong> <br />
            <span class="text">Homebuilding      is a highly specialized and complex process. And like builders themselves,      no two clients are exactly the same. Some homeowners are very interested in      the homebuilding process, while others are more content to follow the lead      of the builder and be available only when needed. Most clients fall      somewhere in between. Regardless of their approach or comfort level with      new home construction, clients play a vital role in its success.<br />
          The      ideal homeowner leads by example; making appropriate and timely decisions      to help ensure the home is completed on schedule. In addition, pro-active      homeowners become educated about the home building process so that they      understand and respect its nuances.<br />
          A      critical part of that education is knowing what is and is not in a      builder's control and having realistic expectations for how issues will be      managed, questions answered, and problems solved.<br />
          One of      the most obvious issues is the weather. Rain, freezing temperatures, and      other severe climate conditions are out of any earthly being's control.      When the weather results in delays in the delivery of materials or their      installation, however, it can have a ripple effect on the entire      construction schedule. While professional builders cannot control the      weather, they can prepare for it by communicating regularly with      subcontractors and materials suppliers to gauge their availability once the      weather clears and keeping homeowners informed about changes to the      schedule.<br />
          Likewise,      outside circumstances -- such as a natural disaster in another part of the      country, or even global trade trends -- may cause the cost and availability      of construction materials and labor to become volatile or unreliable. With      proper controls in place, however, a professional builder should be able to      mitigate or adjust for delays and cost overruns by providing adequate lead      time for materials delivery and making sure each trade partner finishes his      phase of the work before the next one begins.<br />
          To avoid      other common delays, smart and successful builders are aware of how long it      takes to get approval from the local building department to begin      construction and the amount of time an inspector needs to schedule a job      site visit to check over the progress to date.<br />
          But even      under the best of circumstances, barring any problems caused by weather or      other outside forces, there's always a risk in relying on other people to      help complete any job, whether it's the construction of a house, providing      input on a financial report, or creating an advertising campaign.      Increasingly, the housing industry exemplifies this shared responsibility      among a complex network of players, as builders rely on subcontractors and      materials suppliers to deliver pieces of the puzzle on time, within budget,      and according to specifications and standards.<br />
          In fact,      a builder's role is often akin to a manager as much as it is a craftsman.      Builders must manage complex scheduling and supervision of various trade      partners. It's a job that requires no less skill than building a wall or      installing a heating system.<br />
          As a      homeowner, consider what you can reasonably expect your builder to control.      Communicate with your builder to be sure he knows and agrees with those      expectations. This will help ensure a coordinated effort toward achieving      overall success and satisfaction with the finished home.<br />
          Warm      Regards,<br />
