                  <p><em>Q: What is C&amp;D waste?</em></p>
A: &quot;C&amp;D&quot;  waste refers to debris created from the construction and demolition processes  of a building project. In fact, it represents a large percentage of the overall  waste stream created in this country. There are several efforts underway to  divert C&amp;D waste, such as scrap lumber, drywall, and concrete, away from  landfills and into recycling streams that extend the use of the resources to  make building products.</td>

        <td height="1694"><h1>5  Key Questions for Your Builder</h1>
          <p class="text">You've  finally decided to build that dream house and have invited us into your living  room or have cornered us in our sales center. Now what?</p>
          <p class="text">As a  professional homebuilder, we are prepared to answer any questions you have as  you make a purchasing decision, arguably one of the most important financial  choices in your life.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">But while we  encourage and welcome this dialogue, we often find that homebuyers aren't  typically prepared for that opportunity. In many cases, the questions we get  are limited to how much does a new house cost (or cost per square foot), what  are the carpet or cabinet choices, and whether we can cut a deal.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">While those  are valid questions, we think they only scratch the surface of what homebuyers  need to know to help ensure a satisfying experience with our company or any  professional builder.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">So here are  the top five questions we think homebuyers should ask when they are on the cusp  of building a new home with us...and why they matter:</p>
          <ol start="1" type="1">
            <li>
              <p class="text"><em><strong>Who will run the job?</strong></em><br />
                We will assign a site superintendent skilled in new home construction to       be your main point of contact from groundbreaking through the final walk       through. It is important to know who that is, and how to contact him or       her, to get the most accurate and up-to-date information and answer       questions about your new house. We believe this gives you the best of both       worlds; a dedicated supervisor as your day-to-day go to person along with       availability from our entire staff in support of you and your new home.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="text"><em><strong>Will workers be there all day, every day?</strong></em><br />
                Understanding how we work and the pacing of a typical new home       construction process is critical to having a positive experience. In fact,       sometimes (if not often), there are very few people on the jobsite, but       that doesn't mean things aren't progressing. There may be an inspection       scheduled or a delivery on the way that will trigger crews and       subcontractors to return and continue their work...perhaps even later that       day, if not the next morning. We keep a tight schedule and our business       depends on being efficient, but there are occasional lulls in the process       that we'll point out when we go over the building schedule with you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="text"><em><strong>How often can I stop by the jobsite?</strong></em><br />
                Your site superintendent will set up a regular schedule for you to visit       the site, ask any questions, and discuss the project and its progress,       usually at key points in the process. Unscheduled visits can affect the       schedule and pace of work...and be dangerous depending on the work going       on.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="text"><em><strong>Can you supply references?</strong></em><br />
                We are happy to provide you with a list of people who have recently       purchased homes from us, and we encourage you to call them and ask about       their experience and level of satisfaction as you make your own purchasing       decision. Any professional builder should have references at the ready,       including financial partners, trade contractors, materials suppliers, and       others we work with that can provide perspective on our professionalism       and track record of performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="text"><em><strong>How do you handle changes?</strong></em><br />
                Most people don't ask this question because they can't envision making a       change to a decision during construction, but it happens all the time. We       work diligently with you to create a detailed list of specifications for       your house before we break ground, but we also have change order policies       and procedures in place -- which we share with you up front and in the       sales contract -- to account for changes after building begins.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text">Armed with  the answers to this handful of questions, we think you'll be more confident in  your homebuying decisions and more likely to be satisfied with the end result.          </p>
          <p><span class="text">Warm Regards,</span><span class="text"><br />
