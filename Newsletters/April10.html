            <em>Q: What's the difference between an option and an upgrade?</em></p>
A: Options, also called  standard options or specifications, are typically products or finishes (such as  flooring or lighting) that are already included in the quoted, advertised, or  negotiated price of a new home. Builders often allow buyers to choose among  standard options to &quot;customize&quot; the new home. An upgrade (or upgraded  option) is a more expensive and/or higher performing alternative beyond a  standard option. The upgrade almost always adds to the cost of the house and  may add to the time needed to complete it.</td>

        <td><p><strong>Building is Better </strong>          </p>
          <p class="text">Is it better  to build a new home or remodel an older one? No one will be surprised to hear  us argue that building a new home is the better choice, just as a remodeling  contractor would argue the opposite.</p>
          <p class="text">So, with our  professional bias disclosed, here are some totally objective reasons why we  believe buying a new home provides greater benefits than remodeling.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Better  Construction.</strong> Today's new homes, specifically those offered by a professional builder  dedicated to high performance and durability, are better built than those of  even a decade ago, and much better built than those of a generation ago.</p>
          <p class="text">In every  aspect, from windows and doors to structural and mechanical systems, a new home  today is built to deliver a higher, more integrated level of comfort,  convenience, flexibility, and efficiency. As a result, a new home stands up  better to inclement weather conditions, requires less maintenance, and costs  less to heat and cool than an existing home. Even when older homes are upgraded  with new products and systems, the outdated structural and mechanical elements  cannot integrate these products for their optimum performance.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Lifestyle  Flexibility.</strong> New homes are designed to accommodate changing lifestyles and household  circumstances. Open floor plans with bonus or extra rooms enable homeowners to  use and re-use spaces as home offices, nurseries, in-law suites, art studios,  or workshops to suit practical needs and whimsical passions throughout the life  of the home.<br />
            By contrast,  home remodeling is typically done to address an immediate need, such as making  room for an in-home business or an elderly parent, which may not suit a future  need or stage in life. New homes are designed and equipped to allow the owners  to age in place. This type of design is the owners' best insurance against the  need for future big remodeling projects or moves to another home.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Financial  Stability.</strong> Because of their superior construction and lifestyle flexibility, new homes  hold their value better than older ones, especially those that have not been  remodeled to modern standards. Even the older home that has been well remodeled  to accommodate a specific need -- such as the room for the in-home business or  elderly parent -- will not appeal to future buyers who don't share the same  household circumstances. By contrast, a well-designed and built new home will  appeal to a large population of potential buyers, if and when that time comes.  At the very least, the new home will show a greater increase in value because  of its mass appeal.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Pride  in Ownership.</strong> Whether you buy a new home or remodel your existing home, you are a homeowner.  However, a new home differs from an older home because of the choices that  professional builders allow the new owner to make. If you decide to build, you  can suit your personal tastes and needs. When you tailor a new home from the  ground up, you not only have the pleasure of achieving a 'perfect fit' but also  the long-term satisfaction of having created a more satisfying, comfortable,  and convenient home. The element of personal creativity adds great pride in  ownership.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>The  Hassle Factor.</strong> Living through a remodeling project can be very stressful on a family's  day-to-day routines. Although a new-home project presents some challenges, it  is done without intruding on existing home life. New owners can relax (at least  a little), maintain normal family life and enjoy the creative process instead  of dreading the dirt and noise. With the right builder, visiting the new house  under construction, witnessing its progress, and moving into a space in which  everything is brand new is an exciting and fulfilling experience.<br />
            As a  professional builder, we favor building a new home over remodeling an existing  house and we believe that our preference is not mere bias. We think we have set  out some persuasive and objective arguments to make our case!</p>
