              <em>Q: What is &quot;structured&quot; or advanced wiring?</em> <br />
A:    The combined growth of personal home computers, consumer electronics,    entertainment systems, and home security products-not to mention the dynamic    evolution of the technology behind themâ€”has prompted GEMINI HOMES, INC. to    offer wiring schemes that enable whole-house communications, data and    audio-visual sharing, and other features. Typically consisting of Category 5    (or &quot;Cat-5&quot;) wiring and coaxial cable, structured or advanced    wiring schemes allow homeowners to customize their use of technology to meet    their lifestyle needs. <br />

        <td><p class="header2">That Spacious New Home Feel: By Design!</p>
          <p class="text">Does it seem  to you that new homes are generally bigger than older ones? If so, your  observation is correct. The average new home today is nearly 500 square feet  (or 25%) larger than the average house built 20 years ago, and 12% larger than  those built in the late 1990s.</p>
          <p class="text">However,  mere square footage is not the primary reason why new homes are more spacious  than their predecessors.<br />
            Homes are  now designed to enhance the perception of larger space and to allow a variety  of functions in the common areas of the home. Open floor plans, increasingly  popular across all housing types, sizes and prices, create long views through  the home and afford &quot;shared&quot; spaces that serve multiple needs.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">The perfect  example of this concept is the combination kitchen-eating nook-family room. An  uninterrupted view from either end makes this space appear quite large as each  &quot;area&quot; spills easily into the next. A kitchen island extended into  the eating area, for instance, may serve as the family's everyday dining area,  homework or bill-paying center, or craft counter. In turn, that area  transitions seamlessly into the family room where family members and guests can  relax but stay in touch with activity and conversations in the kitchen -- where  the cook used to be isolated!<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">This perceived  space is made even greater by a row of windows along the long wall of the room  looking into the back yard. More windows may be located on the kitchen and/or  family room end-walls.&nbsp; A GREAT example of this is our Jasmyn Plan at 363  Roseberry Circle.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">These  windows extend the long interior view even further to the exterior of the  house, giving the illusion of more space inside. Extensive daylight --  especially from three walls -- also creates a more comfortable and energy  efficient living space.<br />
            The benefits  of the open plan kitchen-eating nook-family room are now being extended to  include other rooms on the main floor of the house. Passageways from the living  room and formal dining rooms to the more informal areas of the house are  uninterrupted by doors to maintain the shared usage and long sightlines that  create the feeling of spaciousness.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">The open  plan concept is taken to its extreme in floor plans that eliminate the  distinction between living room and family room to create a &quot;great  room&quot; that is entirely open to other areas of the house. Another variant,  the loft-style house (born out of urban industrial warehouse space adapted to  residential use) offers an open floor plan that is completely flexible in its  use -- and therefore appears to be the most spacious option of all.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Other design  features that enhance perceived or actual space in new homes include the use of  higher ceilings -- most effective in large rooms where good proportion can be  maintained, an example&nbsp;of our home at 316 Roseberry Circle -- and greater  access to usable outdoor living areas. Patios, decks and balconies fitted with  furnishings, cooking and eating areas, pools and spas, and lounge areas with  flat-screen TVs and fireplaces are a more recent and popular innovation in new  homes that actually boosts a home's practical footprint.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">In summary,  it is clear that design trends in new homes offer greater space and lifestyle  flexibility. Existing homes, even those from a decade ago, cannot match the  spacious look and feel of new homes. Call  GEMINI HOMES, INC. for your design needs!</p>
