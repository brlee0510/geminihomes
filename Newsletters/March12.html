                  <p><em>Q: What is a cool roof?</em></p>
A: A cool roof is defined  as a roof that either reflects the sun’s heat away from the roof or is designed  to ventilate a narrow airspace under the roof finish to keep it cool. Either  way, the result lowers the temperature of the home’s attic space, which helps  reduce the amount of energy needed to cool the house.</td>

        <td height="1694"><h1>Design  for All Ages</h1>
          <p class="text">Universal  Design, or UD, is an architectural practice that allows occupants of all ages  and capabilities to live independently and comfortably over a long period of  time in the same house.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Thanks to  changing demographics, UD is gaining mainstream acceptance. In addition to Baby  Boomers looking for well-designed conveniences as they enter their retirement  years, an increasing number of multigenerational and blended families (now  one-third of all households) seek new homes that accommodate a wide range of  ages and capabilities.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Done well,  the UD elements of a new home are subtle, almost undetectable ... until you  need them. Then you'll thank your builder for having the forethought and  concern for your needs, whether for a young child, an elderly parent, or  someone recovering from a short-term injury or long-term disability.</p>
          <p class="text">While you  may have to look closely, here are some strategies that incorporate good  universal design:<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Wider  hallways and doors.</strong> It doesn't take much square footage and certainly no  more construction time or cost to design and build slightly wider hallways and  doorways. Not only does that subtle change make a home feel larger and more  comfortable, but also easier to navigate.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Cabinet  features.</strong> Long desired for bigger base cabinets, pull-out (or roll-out) shelves are an  increasingly popular option for tall and upper wall cabinets, making their  contents more visible and accessible. Regardless of age or physical  capabilities, accessories such as lazy susans, door shelves, slotted drawers,  and flip-down fronts enhance the storage capacity and accessibility of kitchen  cabinets and bath vanities. Soft-close drawers, meanwhile, protect against  pinched fingers.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Hard-surface  flooring.</strong> Yes, it's slightly more expensive than wall-to-wall carpeting, but a  combination of hardwood, polished flat tiles, colored concrete, and resilient  floor surfaces throughout the house is not only easier to clean and promote  healthier indoor air quality, but also easier to traverse. Where needed, area  rugs can soften the surfaces.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Lever  handles.</strong> For doors, sinks and showers, a single-lever handle instead of a knob (or two)  is both fashionable and easier to manipulate. A lever is a better option when  you have an armful of groceries, are just able to reach the handle, or lack the  strength for gripping. For faucets and showers, levers also allow easier  temperature control, which mitigates scalding hazards. Also look for  &quot;D&quot;-shaped handles or grips on cabinet doors and drawers instead of  conventional knobs.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Appliances.</strong> Wall ovens and  warming drawers, dishwasher and refrigerator drawers (set side-by-side, not  stacked), French-door style refrigerators, and microwave ovens with flip-down  doors are just a few examples of appliances that are not only popular but also  deliver UD benefits of accessibility and safety.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">The market  for products and systems that enable attractive yet more accessible home design  and function is growing. Professional builders and their home-buyers have many  options to create a more accessible, beautiful and contemporary home that suits  a wider variety of lifestyle needs now and in the future.</p>
