                  <span class="textwhite"><em>Q:      What is an &quot;insulated&quot; window?</em> <br />
              A:      Modern windows are often referred to as &quot;insulated&quot; because of      technology that retards, blocks, or slows the transfer of air through the      unit. Most people are familiar with fiberglass or other types of insulation      material in a wall cavity. In a window, the &quot;insulation&quot; is a      combination of several factors. Most common are windows with at least two      panes of glass enclosing a 'dead' airspace between them. The airspace may      also be sealed to contain a clear, odorless gas (commonly argon), which is      heavier than air and thus an even more effective insulator. Better yet, one      or both inside surfaces of the glass can be permanently laminated with a      clear coating that further retards thermal transfer and protects the home      interior against solar heat gain and damaging ultraviolet rays.</span></p></td>

            Walk      into any new home and you'll immediately notice a big difference from many      older homes: an abundance of natural light. Because of poor thermal      performance, windows and glass doors in older homes were necessarily scaled      down. Today's builders, however, are able to take advantage of advanced      technologies, a wider range of sizes and styles, and a number of new      products and creative applications to capture natural light. <br />
            For      clients who prefer a modern look, glass walls are certainly possible to      maximize natural light. For those preferring traditional housing design,      professional builders usually work within historic housing forms to      increase interior natural light. Window and door manufacturers have helped      this effort by providing a wide variety of products to match traditional      house styles. <br />
            For      example, a roof window (or series of these units) over the center of the      kitchen can bring in a tremendous amount of natural light without having an      adverse impact on a traditional facade. This is especially true if that      room is on the back or side of the house and thus out of view from the      street. Unlike skylights, roof windows can open to vent stagnant or hot air      and odors. They have a flat design, only slightly raised above the roof      finish, which further reduces any intrusive appearance. <br />
            For      smaller interior rooms, such as a water closet, walk-in shower, or storage      area, traditional approaches to bringing in natural light are almost      impossible, or at least impractical. Tubular skylights offer a solution.      From a small, unobtrusive opening in the roof, light enters a tube lined      with mirrors and reflective material that reflect light into the room      below. These small devices pour large quantities of light into tight      spaces, making them feel more spacious and comfortable. <br />
            Fixed or      operable transom windows may also be used to bring natural light into      interior rooms. Set above passage doors to bedrooms and bathrooms or even      in interior walls, transom windows can carry natural light from rooms on      the outside perimeter into otherwise dark, inner spaces. <br />
            A      kitchen backsplash can be used creatively to increase natural light. Glass      block or fixed panes of glass may be installed in the space between the      countertop and the wall cabinets. Light is brought onto the work surface      without sacrificing kitchen cabinets for a large window expanse. <br />
            When      homeowners prefer traditional architectural styles, experienced home      builders will assist homeowners with design and product solutions, made      easier with the wide array of technologically advanced windows and doors      now available. With new products to choose from and some creative design      work, home owners are simultaneously able to enjoy their home style of      choice and the aesthetic and cost-saving benefits of natural light. <br />
