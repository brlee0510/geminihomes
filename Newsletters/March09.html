                    <em>Q:      What is &quot;engineered&quot; lumber, and is it better than regular      lumber?</em> <br>
            A:      Engineered lumber, also called engineered wood or composite lumber, is an      established alternative to traditional (or milled) lumber in a variety of      building construction applications. Though made from smaller and younger      trees (thus helping preserve stands of old-growth timber), it is      manufactured (or engineered) into common lumber dimensions that are      stronger, straighter, and more reliable than milled lumber. As a result,      builders and contractors can use fewer pieces, helping reduce labor and      materials costs while achieving a superior structure.</span></span></p></td>

              </p>
              <p class="text">Do you      know what CGR or CGB stands for? How about CAPS or AIA? Do letters after      the name of an architect, builder or contractor confuse you or do they      provide you with useful information?<br>
              In fact,      these acronyms demonstrate something important: a commitment to      professional business practices and project management skills that help      ensure quality and a hassle-free experience for clients considering a      construction project. Some acronyms can help you identify a builder's      specialty. Others indicate a level of third-party support and certification      regarding a contractor's ability to complete a project on time and on      budget to a client's satisfaction.</p>
              <p class="text">Here's a      primer on what some of the most common designations mean and why they are a      component in the process of selecting the right builder or contractor for      your project.<br>
                </p>
              <p class="text"><em>Certified      Graduate Builder </em>or <em>Remodeler      (CGB/CGR). </em>Offered by the National Association of Home      Builders, these certifications result from extensive classroom,      correspondence, and job site curriculum regarding all aspects of running a      successful building or remodeling operation. The <em>Graduate Master Builder (GMB)</em> program provides even greater depth for the most experienced builders.<br>
                </p>
              <p class="text"><em>Certified      Aging-in-Place Specialist (CAPS). </em>Designed to serve both new and existing      homeowners, this certification indicates that the contractor has the      knowledge essential to creating and modifying homes that will accommodate      changing lifestyle and physical needs as the occupants age.<br>
                </p>
              <p class="text"><em>Residential      Construction Superintendent (RCS) </em>and <em>National      Housing Quality (NHQ) certification. </em>These programs qualify      builders and specialty trade contractors, such as framers and insulation      workers, to manage both their businesses and their work on the construction      site. Once certified, contractors must submit annual reports to be      re-qualified and maintain their status.<br>
                </p>
              <p class="text"><em>AIA.</em> This designation      marks members of the American Institute of Architects, the nation's leading      organization for licensed architects. Achieving AIA status requires a      degree in architecture as well as practical experience. Licensing includes      an extensive test similar to the bar exam for attorneys. Members must      adhere to the AIA Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and earn a      minimum number of continuing education credits sanctioned by the      association in order to maintain membership.<br>
                </p>
              <p class="text"><em>American      Institute of Building Design (AIBD). </em>Like AIA, the AIBD is a national      organization supporting design professionals, specifically those focused on      residential work. AIBD membership affords designers access to the latest      business, client relations, and building code information to ensure that      their design work meets regulatory standards and are to their clients'      satisfaction.<br>
                </p>
              <p class="text"><em>Member,      Institute of Residential Marketing (MIRM). </em>A top-level      achievement for people within an organization who focus on the marketing      aspects of residential construction, such as market research, sales      promotions, advertising, and public relations. Other sales-related      distinctions include Master Certified New Home Sales Professional (Master      CSP) and Certified New Home Marketing Professional (CMP).<br>
              </p>
              <p class="text">This      list is just a smattering of the certifications available to professional      builders and contractors who want to enhance their technical and management      skills. It should be remembered, however, that such distinctions are      neither a shield nor a guarantee. Smart homeowners recognize these acronyms      and what they represent, but use them as <em>part      of</em> a thorough process of winnowing and selecting the right builder      or contractor for their project. In essence, these and other distinctions      provide a baseline of professionalism that consumers can rely upon to help      ensure a successful construction project.<br>
