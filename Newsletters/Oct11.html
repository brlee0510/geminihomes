          <p><em>Q: Why not guarantee energy savings?</em></p>
A: There are some builders  and green building certification programs that will guarantee a certain amount  of energy use or cost savings for a new home and provide rebates if those  results fall short. For the most part, however, energy saving is very difficult  to calculate and predict, as it depends on the baseline (what you might  use/spend in a non-green home), local energy rates, and the behavior of the  occupants, to name a few variables.<h2>&nbsp;</h2></td>

        <td height="1694"><h1>Practical  Green </h1>
          <p class="text">Green  building is certainly a hot topic these days. For builders striving to reduce  the environmental footprints of the homes they build, the process encompasses a  wide range of materials, products and systems.</p>
          <p class="text">But does  building green really mean anything to you as a homebuyer? You may recognize  and perhaps even appreciate seeing the Energy Star label on windows and  appliances, but what's the tangible benefit of recycled-content drywall or  certified wood doors to your daily life ... and your pocketbook?</p>
          <p class="text">As a  professional builder who is ready and able to respond to what our homebuyers  want -- including homes with better energy efficiency and indoor air quality --  we also recognize that buyers need to see how our efforts impact them  personally.</p>
          <p class="text">To that end,  we strive to educate our clients about the various “green building” methods and  materials we employ. Along with contributing to our planet, we approach this  from the perspective of the practical benefits to our owners and their  families.</p>
          <p><strong>Hidden  Gems.</strong> <span class="text">The bulk of a comprehensive green building effort happens behind the finishes.  Instead of touting the R-value of the attic insulation or the solar heat gain  coefficient of the windows, we talk about comfort: no more drafty feelings by  windows and doors; no more temperature differences between floors or rooms; the  ability to walk around in your bare feet. Those benefits seem to resonate far  better than any technical information.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Easy  Recycling.</strong> <span class="text">We not only want to encourage but also help facilitate recycling household  waste. So we increasingly provide convenient bins within the kitchen and  laundry cabinets to make it easier to collect those items and get them to the  curb and out of the landfill.</span></p>
          <p class="text">In that same  vein, we have also installed handy compost bins in the kitchen to collect  vegetable clippings and other organic matter that can be added to a larger  compost pile or collector outside and used to improve soil for a vegetable or  flower garden -- allowing homebuyers to extend an interest in local produce and  organic foods.</p>
          <p><strong>Breathe  Easier.</strong> <span class="text">To help save energy and boost indoor comfort, green builders often use  non-toxic paints, flooring, and other interior finishes -- as well as  ventilation systems -- that improve the quality of the indoor air.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Rather than  explore the world of vent fans and semi-gloss paint, we often phrase our  efforts in terms that address allergies, respiratory problems, and other  sensitivities that our homebuyers might suffer ... and will appreciate not  having in their new homes.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text"><strong>Future  Green: Monitors and Electric Cars.</strong> While certainly not mainstream, in-home  computer programs that allow homeowners to see and adjust their use of energy  and water are great visual reminders of green building efforts that also help  to optimize them.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Similarly,  we've seen electric car chargers that run on the home's electrical service (or  even solar energy) that can accommodate all-electric or hybrid cars, allowing  homeowners to conveniently serve that investment in sustainable living.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">The bottom  line is that builders often get caught up in the details and technical specs of  green building; professional builders understand that to be truly beneficial,  those efforts have to improve the quality of everyday life.</span></p>
          <span class="text"> Warm Regards,<br />
