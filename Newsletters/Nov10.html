Gemini  Homes, Inc. was selected by the Builders Association of South Central KY as  “BEST IN SHOW” less than 3000 sq. ft. during the 2010 Parade of Homes. Judging  is based on quality, style and design, and judged by our peers. We would like  to thank everyone who helped us make this “show stopper” possible! If you  didn’t get a chance to see this new Gemini Home during the parade, give Kelly a  call, he’d be happy to schedule an appointment for your viewing.<br />

            <em>Q: What is &quot;low-e&quot; in windows?</em></p>
A: The term  &quot;low-e&quot; refers to a coating or thin, nearly invisible film on window  glass that lowers the emissivity or radiated heat through the window. The  result is a cooler glass surface and a reduction in the transfer of heat into  the living space, making it more comfortable and the home more energy  efficient. Low-e glass is now standard on most windows or an easy upgrade on  others.</td>

            </p>
          <p class="text">Economic  hard times or not, new homes are still being built across the country and in  our community. But housing industry and new-home style 'experts' have noted a  change in how people are approaching those projects. The trend seems to be  toward more conservative and value-oriented choices.<br />
            We've been  paying attention to those trends. We are committed to be responsive to the  needs of our homebuyers by being prepared to help make design selections or  suggestions for their new home.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">As you read  this list, keep in mind that our clients' specific and unique wants and desires  trump any trend. Consider the following as observations. They are not intended  as mandates.<br />
            A few of the  primary themes we've noticed include:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text">People       are looking for American made finishes and quality products that will last       longer and reduce energy and resource use. Homeowners want to lessen       ongoing maintenance and replacement costs. </p>
              </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text">Given       that higher-quality and resource-efficient materials and products may cost       more, consumers are gravitating toward &quot;minimalist&quot; design       schemes and a conservative color palette accented with a few bright, bold       accessories. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text">We       like our technology! New homes are a great way to accommodate greater and       more convenient access to it -- namely, by providing an ample amount of       wiring and cable (and multiple outlets) to plug in and recharge mobile       gadgets. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text">Regardless       of square footage, we see a call for greater storage capacity. Modular       organizing systems for closets and garages expand the usable space of       those areas. We've also investigated the need for an electronic       &quot;clutter closet&quot; near the most-used entry door (sometimes from       the garage) to hold -- and perhaps recharge -- a variety of electronic       devices in a convenient, central location. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text">Grey       is the new white ... at least according to some style experts.       Grey-stained wood and fabrics represents the &quot;back to basics&quot;       trend of the new economy. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text">Though       not as opulent or outfitted as they were a few years back, outdoor areas       remain a popular way to extend usable living space. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text">Home       offices continue to be in demand, accommodating in-home businesses or       telecommuting trends. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text">One       thing that seems to be on the decline: a home theater, at least as a       dedicated room within a house. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text">Reports  indicate that buyers of new homes and other consumer goods have altered their  value systems toward more conservative, durable and space and  resource-efficient products. We're keeping close tabs on those trends to meet  our clients' needs.</p>
