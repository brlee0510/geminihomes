          <p><em>Q: Should I demand a low-VOC exterior paint?</em></p>
A: The EPA has developed a  number of programs designed to reduce pollution by setting standards that lower  VOC's (Volatile Organic Compounds) found in paint. These reformulated paints  reduce VOC's which help protect our ozone layer. Interior paint and other  interior finishes containing VOC's may pose a health hazard when occupants  breathe VOC emissions. Consult your builder and his painting contractor for  recommendations.<h2>&nbsp;</h2></td>

          <p>A home's exterior  finish is literally its face to the world. The right combination of material,  color, and texture deliver a lasting impression, evoke pride and create value.  The right exterior finishes for a given climate and their proper installation  reduce ongoing maintenance chores and repair costs.<br />
            </p>
          <p>In our  experience, there are several factors that help ensure the long-term quality  and value of exterior finishes, namely:<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Top-Quality  Materials.</strong> There's no substitute for the best-made roofing, siding, and trim/accent  materials. As a professional builder, we work to find the best available  quality exterior materials within our client's budget. Climate conditions and  the style of the house can also dictate materials selections; wood might be a  good choice for a moderate climate, but perhaps not in extended extreme weather  conditions.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Professional  Installation.</strong> An exterior finish is only as good as its installation. We work with and  supervise professional installers to install and finish exterior products  properly. We then inspect and approve their work. To ensure long-term value,  lasting good looks, and low maintenance, we use the recommended type and number  of fasteners, allow for slight, climate-induced shrinking and swelling, and  seal joints between materials to avoid buckling and separation.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Water  Resistance.</strong> We've learned to respect water. We avoid water intrusion behind exterior  finishes by utilizing systems that shed and vent it away before it causes any  damage requiring maintenance, extensive repairs or replacement.<br />
            Common  solutions include weather-resistant barriers for the roof and sidewalls,  flashing around windows and doors, metal drip edges and kick-out flashing at  roof eaves. Where necessary we provide airspaces and weep holes for brick or  stone veneers and rain screens behind stucco finishes.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Proper  Painting.</strong> The value of a high-quality, exterior-rated paint cannot be overstated. Paint  must be applied over a well-prepared surface... a job in itself. We apply a  universally thick layer of paint which can often last twice as long as the  conventional 7-10 years before it requires a new coat. The best way to achieve  full coverage and a uniform thickness is with a sprayer (not brushes or  rollers) and it is essential that the paint be applied over a completely dry  surface.<br />
          </p>
          <p>For  wood-based siding, such as clapboards or shingles, we may specify a  factory-applied primer that encases the entire panel against moisture and  enables better adhesion with the finish coat.<br />
          </p>
          <p>As a  professional builder, we take pride not just in how our new homes perform and  meet a buyer's needs, but also how they look -- especially over time. We also  want to minimize ongoing maintenance chores and avoid expensive repairs or  replacements. Properly applied exterior finishes are critical to achieving  those goals and exceeding the expectations of our homebuyers.</p>
Warm Regards,<br />
