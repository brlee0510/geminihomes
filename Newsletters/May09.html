                    <em>Q:      What is the role of a superintendent?</em> <br />
            A: A      superintendent, or &quot;lead,&quot; is the person in charge of managing      the day-to-day activity and progress on the job site during construction,      and is typically the homeowners' primary point of contact with the building      company. Depending on your builder, the 'super' could be the owner or his      representative. Often, builders hire superintendents to manage the      day-to-day activities on the site. This frees the business owner to stay      connected with a number of customers and concentrate on business management      issues.</span></span></p></td>

              <strong>Understanding your      Builder </strong></strong></span> <br />
              <span class="text">Let's      face it: Homebuilders don't always have the best reputations. The prospect      of building a new home can cause a lot of anxiety, stemming from a      combination of mystery, misperceptions, myths, and illusions most people      have about the homebuilding profession. <br />
              While      some builders earn that reputation, the professional builder successfully      exposes any preconceived notions a prospective buyer might have about the      building business and the construction process. They work hard to clarify      their motivations and approach to construction. They seek to view the      project from the client's perspective and meet their needs and desires. <br />
              Getting      to know a builder can foster a greater respect and a higher level of      confidence for a company's ability to deliver a high-quality new home. <br />
              First,      it is important to understand that professional builders are business      people. They build homes because it's their chosen profession. Of course,      like anyone, they are interested in making money; a professional builder,      however, makes money honestly, and seeks to earn a reasonable profit. <br />
              Like      other successful builders, we constantly refine our approach to business,      adhere to predetermined building schedules, and establish reliable and      lasting partnerships with building products suppliers, financial      institutions, and specialty trade contractors. We live in the areas where      we build and are active in our communities. We rely on a strong local      reputation to continue to build our business. <br />
              Some      builders, though, lack the business and communication skills to be      successful, resulting in dissatisfied customers and ruined reputations that      often blanket the entire industry. This is not an industry-wide scheme to      separate homebuyers from their money. Rather, it's just an unfortunate      slice of society that both buyers and professional builders have to endure. <br />
              Unlike      almost any other industry, a builder's work is exposed to the public; while      cars and washing machines are assembled in factories and seen only on the      showroom floor, a house is on display from foundation to finish. This can      lead to misinterpretations or misunderstandings between a builder and a      homebuyer. Often, however, what looks to be incomplete or irregular during      one stage of construction is quite different from the eventual finished      product. <br />
              Given      those circumstances it is also important to understand that builders are      engaged in the home building process every day and over many years. They      gain experience and have a unique perspective. They have a vision of a      home's progress that extends well beyond daily progress, one that few      owners can truly share or comprehend. <br />
              As a      result of that perspective, a builder may occasionally appear unconcerned      or take a casual approach to what a nervous homebuyer perceives to be a      problem on the job site. Simply, the builder has likely seen or heard about      it a million times during his career, knows implicitly how he'll deal with      it (assuming it needs to be dealt with), and has significantly less emotion      invested in a home than a client does. <br />
              Successful      builders listen closely to their buyers' concerns, respect an owner's      questions and patiently communicate solutions. They understand that      building a house is a considerable emotional investment, a potential source      of anxiety, and a financial risk, and work to ease those burdens. <br />
              By the      same token, an informed and understanding homebuyer recognizes that the      construction process is second nature to a professional builder. When both      a homeowner and a builder respect each other's roles and approaches to the      business of homebuilding, it fosters better and more open communication,      the opportunity to develop trust, and the prospect of achieving a      successful and satisfying project. <br />
