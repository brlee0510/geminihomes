            <em>Q: How difficult is it to move a wall to enlarge a room?</em></p>
A: That depends. If the  wall is non-structural (meaning it is not vital to the home's stability),  moving it slightly is usually an easy undertaking. However, if moving the wall  affects the size or location of a door, window opening or other feature in that  room or an adjacent space, the alteration is more difficult, time-consuming, and  costly. The movement of a structural wall (one that is vital to the home's  stability) is often prohibitively difficult.</td>

        <td><p><strong class="header"><span class="header2">The Media Room</span></strong></p>
          <p class="text">The concept  of a &quot;media room,&quot; as a space specifically devoted to home theater  and audio systems, is more popular than ever. New home designers and builders,  responding to the demand of their buyers, have incorporated media rooms into  the floor plans of many new homes, all along the price spectrum. Such rooms are  designed for comfortable television and movie viewing and are acoustically  separated from the rest of the house.</p>
          <p class="text">Now,  professional homebuilders and their design teams are responding to the  evolution of media technology with new &quot;media room&quot; features.&nbsp;  These new, sophisticated spaces can incorporate multiple, flat-panel plasma or  LCD displays for watching broadcast television, surfing the Internet, and  playing video games. Also included -- by client demand -- are surround-sound  audio, multi-port outlets and docks. These enable a wide range of consumer  electronics, multipurpose furnishings and built-ins that suit both card and  electronic game players.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Yes, the  media room has become the game room, again driven by homebuyer demand and a  host of new (mostly electronic) toys. Builders are educating their buyers about  the lifestyle advantages of including such a project and the value it adds to  their property.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Consider  some of the special features that a true Game Room encompasses, all of which  are easily accommodated in a new construction project:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li class="text"><strong>Acoustics</strong>.       Sound transmission in or out of a game room can be disruptive. Builders       incorporate products that block or deaden sound through the walls, floors,       and ceilings. Special membranes and laminated drywall and plywood panels       meet the need without adding a lot of extra cost, rendering the Game Room       almost a separate acoustical zone within the house. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li class="text"><strong>Light and shading</strong>. Everyone enjoys natural light ... except when there's       a movie playing. Windows are a prime consideration that maintain flexible       use of the room when the house is sold. The home's exterior appearance       must be considered, as well. To create the optimal movie-watching       experience, builders turn to motorized screens and draperies that smoothly       draw across the windows. Controlled by remote devices or wall-mounted       panels, such screens retract into the wall when not in use or disappear       into a subtle housing to retain the room's overall aesthetic design. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li class="text"><strong>Multiple displays</strong>.&nbsp; One screen may not be enough in the modern Game       Room. Though builders usually leave the purchase of consumer electronics       up to the homebuyers after the house is finished, high-tech game rooms       must be designed and wired to accommodate several displays and multiple signals.       These may include satellite, wireless and wired Internet, cable, personal       computers, and (don't forget!) electricity. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li class="text"><strong>Seating, storage, and snacks</strong>. Like its media room predecessor, the new Game Room is       a gathering place for family and guests, often engaged in multiple       activities at the same time. Space for several zones of comfortable       seating is very popular, as is built-in cabinet storage for all of the       game players, audio and video equipment, and other components. Small       kitchen setups, complete with sink, under-counter appliances, and counter       work space, provide family and guests with additional convenience in this       self-contained haven. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text">Media rooms  are among the new wave of distinct, specialized areas within today's new homes.  The &quot;Game Room&quot; reflects the development of high-tech consumer  electronics and the consumers' desire to maximize enjoyment of these new toys.  As a Professional homebuilder, we are equipped to suggest ways to create space  for a Game Room and to deliver an amenity that satisfies every goal.</p>
