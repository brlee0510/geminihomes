              <p><em>Q: How deep are the pipes of a ground-source heat pump?</em></p>
A: For the most part, the  temperature of the ground becomes predicable and constant at about 8 feet below  the surface. Vertical GSHP piping loops, used in small-lot conditions, are  excavated much deeper to enable an effective transfer of temperature between  the ground and the pipe's fluid.</td>

          <p>Improving  home energy efficiency and building more sustainable housing is no longer a  trend -- it's mainstream. As a professional builder, we feel it's important to  keep up on emerging technologies that may soon help our clients save money,  improve comfort and reduce our impact on the environment.</p>
          <p>In the  spirit of learning about these new technologies, we profile a rising star in  the world of heating and air conditioning: Geothermal (or  &quot;ground-source&quot;) heating and cooling systems. Simply, a geothermal  system uses the temperature of the ground to condition the air that is  distributed through the house using conventional ductwork.<br />
            </p>
          <p>To transfer  ground temperature to the home's central air distribution system, a closed loop  of narrow, flexible pipe is installed at least 8 feet underground, vertically  or horizontally.<br />
            The  temperature of the ground is about 68 degrees. Conductive, non-toxic fluid is  pumped through the pipe and is heated or cooled (depending on its temperature)  by the constant temperature of the ground. When that fluid returns to the  surface, it transfers its temperature to the air being blown into the home's  ductwork.<br />
            </p>
          <p>That's  exactly how conventional, air-sourced heat pumps work, except that those  systems use the temperature of the ambient outdoor air, which is far less  predictable and constant than underground temperatures.<br />
            </p>
          <p>In winter,  for instance, if the thermostat is set at 72 degrees, the heating coils in the  pump only need to boost the incoming ground-conditioned, 68-degree fluid by a  few degrees to achieve the desired temperature. The outdoor air temperature  that day, however, is likely much colder, which requires far more energy from  the pump's heating coils to warm it sufficiently.<br />
            </p>
          <p>Because this  type of ground-source system requires far less supplemental heating or cooling  measures to achieve desired indoor temperature and comfort levels, it uses less  energy. In turn, there's less wear and tear on the heat pump, allowing it to  operate at optimum efficiency for a longer period of time and with less  maintenance.<br />
            </p>
          <p><strong>Cost  and payback:</strong> Until 2016, the Federal Government is offering a 30% tax credit on geothermal  systems with no upper limit. This covers both the cost and installation of the  units. These credits apply to both new construction and existing homes. The  cost to install a geothermal system and the savings vary. Hypothetically, if a  Geothermal system costs twice as much as a conventional air-sourced system, and  cuts the monthly energy use and cost in half, there will be a substantial  return on investment within a few years.<br />
            </p>
          <p>People with  geothermal systems also report better and healthier indoor comfort, especially  in the height of summer or winter when a conventional heat pump has a hard time  conditioning the outside air to the desired indoor temperature.<br />
            Geothermal  heating and cooling systems may not be for everyone or every new-home  condition, but they are a proven, energy-efficient option that delivers better  performance and lessens environmental impact.</p>
          <p>Warm Regards,<br />
