          <p><em>Q: How much is a &quot;square&quot; of roofing?</em></p>
A: In roofing lexicon, a  &quot;square&quot; is equal to 100 square feet of area to be roofed. Builders  and roofing contractors purchase roofing to the nearest square, though as an  owner you should insist on a more precise estimate and purchase to mitigate  cost overruns and waste.<h2>&nbsp;</h2></td>

<p>A roof is a  primary factor in any home's curb appeal. But more important, it serves a  critical role in maintaining or improving energy efficiency, managing water and  moisture, and guarding against damage caused by high winds and fire.<br />
  Recent  upgrades to national building and energy codes place even more responsibility  on builders and contractors to deliver roofs that perform at an even higher  level, prompting roof manufacturers to up their game with better products and a  more systematic approach to residential roofing.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Energy  Efficiency.</strong> Few people think of a roof having much impact on a home's energy demand ...  until you consider that it bears the brunt of the sun's heat every day. Solar  heat can penetrate the roof into the attic, resulting in temperatures that far  exceed the conditioned living spaces below. The hot air in the attic seeps into  the conditioned spaces through gaps in the ceiling, causing a home's cooling  system to work harder to keep the house comfortable.<br />
</p>
<p>The roofing  industry's response has been the advent of so-called &quot;cool roof&quot;  shingles. Available in asphalt composition, concrete tile, metal, and other  non-wood roofing finishes, cool roofs are lighter in color to reflect the sun's  heat away from the house. The Cool Roof Rating Council and federal Energy Star  program verify the reflective quality of various roof finishes to assure their  performance.<br />
</p>
<p>In addition  to the shingles or panels, a cool roof can also be ventilated from underneath.  The roofing finish is held off its plywood deck with battens. Vents along the  ridge and eave enable air to circulate under the shingles, cooling them from  below and insulating the attic from solar heat gain. This circulation also  vents incidental moisture from the roof deck, mitigating potential problems.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Managing  Water.</strong> Obviously, the roof is a home's first line of defense against moisture and  rain. But equally important is the roof's ability to effectively and quickly  shed and direct water runoff away from the house.<br />
</p>
<p>The best  practice to manage water is to properly install the shingles and appropriate  flashing components per the manufacturer's specifications and standards.  Flashings should be constructed along valleys and other V-shaped or odd roof  intersections, at the eave corners (called &quot;kick-outs&quot;), and at every  penetration, such as vent pipes, chimneys, and skylights. Water should flow  down the roof to a gutter and downspout system (which is free of debris),  expelling the water harmlessly away from the home and its foundation.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Durability.</strong> A home's roof also  is an important component in high winds or a wildfire. Recent advancements in  building products, practices, and codes have made today's roof even more  resilient against these forces of nature.<br />
</p>
<p>In addition  to using the proper ring-shank nails and fastener spacing to secure a roof's  plywood deck to the roof trusses, water-resistant membranes between the deck  and conventional roofing felt paper serves as an effective shield against  damage. This would be important should the shingles become broken or loose  during a storm and allow wind and water to reach the deck.<br />
</p>
<p>Of course,  properly fastening the roofing finish to the deck is critical to withstand  damage, while a non-combustible material (basically anything non-wood) will  help to retard the spread of flames should a fire break out.<br />
</p>
<p>By reducing  the potential for wasteful energy use, moisture problems and property loss,  today's roofing systems often earn discounts on home insurance premiums because  they present a lower risk to insurance carriers.<br />
</p>
<p>As a  professional builder, it is our responsibility to build the best home possible.  In addition to ensuring the proper installation of every roofing system, we  also investigate and incorporate additional methods and materials that improve  the performance of the roof and our homes overall.</p>
<p>Warm Regards,<br />
