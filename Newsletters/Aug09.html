A: Energy Star is a federally sponsored program initiated by      the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) in the early 1990s to establish standards for energy efficiency among      a variety of building and consumer products. Products meeting Energy Star      requirements are certified and may carry the programs label, which often      lists a product's annual energy savings compared to a non-Energy      Star-certified product. For more information, including a list of products,      go to <a href="http://www.energystar.gov" target="_blank">www.energystar.gov</a>. </span></p></td>

        <td><p class="title2">Saving Energy for an Independent      America </p>
          <p><span class="text">If there      is one idea shared by all American's it is to lower, and ultimately      eliminate, our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. It seems clear that      there is no single solution that will provide an all encompassing solution      to our energy situation. Along with cultivating new sources of energy and      continuing to utilize our existing oil, gas and coal reserves, energy      conservation plays an important part toward achieving energy independence.<br />
              Today's      professional home builders are aware of the difference they can make in our      Country's energy future. Green Building has arrived and it's here to stay.<br />
              There's      little doubt that today's new homes are much more energy efficient than      those of even a decade ago, and certainly compared to homes built before      the &quot;energy crisis&quot; of the mid-1970s. Incredible improvements in      the performance of windows and doors, major appliances, and heating and      cooling systems have significantly lowered the energy consumption of new      homes, helping lower utility bills and raise the quality of housing overall.<br />
              Builders      do not work in isolation. Government agencies and their building codes have      contributed to pushing energy efficient homebuilding into the mainstream.      Builders must comply with basic levels of home energy consumption      prescribed by governmental code, from minimum window performance standards      to adequate levels of wall and attic insulation and proper fresh-air      ventilation. Codes also set guidelines for reducing moisture and air      infiltration into the structure, which not only saves energy but also reduces      incidences of mold growth and other moisture-related problems.<br />
              In      addition to more stringent and specific codes regarding energy-efficient      homebuilding, there are an increasing variety of independent,      public-private, and federally funded programs that promote the concept and      even certify products and entire homes that meet energy-use standards. The      most recognized among these entities is Energy Star, a government-sponsored      program that certifies the energy use and cost savings of several thousand products      from nearly 1,300 manufacturers, as well as builders and the homes they      build.<br />
              In      response to both codes and independent energy standards, manufacturers of      various building products have not only met the code and other independent      standards, but also developed materials and methods that allow builders to      exceed the minimum and achieve a higher level of energy efficiency for new      homes. Such upgrades or options include super-insulating, multi-pane      windows, extremely efficient furnaces, air-conditioning equipment, and      electronic programmable thermostats.<br />
              Builders      who have taken the mantle of energy efficiency as a cornerstone of their      businesses understand the added value of building homes that use less      energy and cost less to operate. Their considerations extend beyond      specific products. Energy efficiency is best achieved by looking at the      entire system, including design issues and construction procedures, to      achieve the goal of a more energy-efficient, comfortable, and long-lasting      home.<br />
              For      example, consider your heating and cooling system. A builder who specifies      and installs a higher level of insulation in the walls, floor, and ceiling,      seals openings in the structure (including around doors and windows), and      uses products and design techniques that provide natural shading, enable      cross-ventilation, and reduce thermal transfer through your home will be      able to reduce the size of the furnace and air conditioning unit required      to keep your home comfortable year-round. This system approach will often      lower the cost to install and maintain the equipment. Chances are it will      last longer and reduce repair and replacement costs as well.<br />
              Working      together, homebuilders, code agencies, independent certification groups,      and product manufacturers continue to improve the energy efficiency of      today's new homes. As a result, their efforts not only reduce energy use      and costs, but also help stabilize our national economy, create      longer-lasting homes, and boost overall housing value.<br />
