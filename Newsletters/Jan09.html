                    <em>Q:      Isn't &quot;universal design&quot; just another word for handicap      accessible?</em> <br />
            A: While      certainly accommodating physical disabilities, the term &quot;universal      design&quot; is a much broader term that seeks to make the home environment      more comfortable, convenient, and even cost-effective. Universal design      considers the needs of occupants of all ages and abilities, as well as how      those abilities and lifestyle needs change over time. Meanwhile, our      suppliers have stepped up with products that are more ergonomic and      aesthetically pleasing, so that universal design is all but unnoticed, if      superior, to traditional housing design.</span></span></p></td>

                <span class="text">Everyone      has a vision about a dream home. You may have a particular style in mind,      such as a Mediterranean or Colonial. Perhaps a certain room is the focus,      such as a gourmet kitchen or master suite. Your imagination is an important      starting point in your search for a new house, helping to narrow your      choices in a world of possibilities.<br />
              However,      it is often difficult to describe an idea to your spouse or other members      of your family, much less to a builder or architect trying to build the      house that matches that vision. It can be frustrating and time-consuming to      translate dreams into words. To turn the mental vision into reality, it is      critical to document your dreams in a way that allows you and others to see      what you envision. Hands down, the best way to do that is with pictures.<br />
              Begin by      gathering a stack of home and lifestyle magazines (friends will be glad to      give you back issues of whatever stacks of magazines are littering their      living room) and scan through them for photos of homes, rooms, and other      features that match your ideas. When you see something you like, cut it out      and set it aside. Similarly, if you see an article about a particular      feature, floor plan, material, or product that sparks your interest, clip      it out, as well.<br />
              The      trick to this exercise is to work freely. Don't think about it too hard.      Later, you may discard images that, on second glance, don't measure up or      aren't important. Allow yourself to be open to new things that you may not      have thought about, but that are attractive or interesting in some way. It      all helps in formulating a clear idea of what you want in a new home.<br />
              For      example, suppose that you see a photograph of a room that is bold and      eccentric. It is an outrageous room, one you could not live with. Still,      there is something about it that is appealing. Although you are not sure      what it is that attracts you, save that photo, too. When you look at it      later, you may find that it is the rich wall color and the complexity of      texture that draws you. Make a note in the margin: &quot;wall color and      complex texture -- yes, blue staircase and exposed ductwork -- no.&quot;<br />
              Remember      that styles change. Some variables, such as color palettes and types of      kitchen cabinets, will inevitably give way to something new. In your      research, branch out to back issues of magazines, as well as resources on      the internet, in libraries and in bookstores. Give yourself a broad range      of material to consider so that you gain perspective and an understanding      of what characteristics are really important to you.<br />
              Another      tip: Allow sufficient time to build a good collection of photos and clipped      articles. Invest whatever time it takes to have some fun and feel good      about your collection. This is your dream home. It deserves considered      thought rather than a weekend rush job. That being said, a reasonable      deadline will ensure that the process does not grow stale and fizzle out.<br />
              If you      have a spouse or other household members to consider, work together or      encourage them to build their own dream files. Once the hunting is      complete, take time to discuss, consolidate, and arrange file contents in      order of importance. In this way, you are prepared to make mutual decisions      about conflicting options, if necessary, when shopping for a house.<br />
              Professional      builders truly appreciate buyers who know what they want and can      effectively communicate those needs and desires. Documenting your dreams      with a collection of photos and articles will not only crystallize your      dreams for you and your family, but also provide critical information for a      builder as you begin to explore your options in a new home.<br />
