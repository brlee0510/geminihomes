            <em>Q: What does the Energy Star endorsement mean to me?</em> <br />
          A: <a href="http://www.energystar.gov" target="_blank">Energy Star</a> is a    federal program managed jointly by the EPA and the Department of Energy to    identify, verify, and promote products (including entire homes) that save    energy. While a terrific and legitimate gauge of a product's energy    performance, the program does not delve into issues of the product's    manufacturing, packaging, or transportation-all of which has environmental    impact. We suggest using the Energy Star standards as one measure (albeit a    very good one) of a productâ€™s overall environmental performance and benefits. </p></td>

            </p>
          <p class="text">Sadly, going  &quot;green&quot; isn't always about the environment or conserving energy.  Companies in and out of the housing industry make claims that their products  offer environmental benefits -- such as fewer toxins, recycled content, or  resource efficiencies -- but fail to back them up with independent testing,  quantified results, or other forms of verification.<br />
            In many  cases, such claims are simply misstated or overstated in an effort to grab your  attention and sell products. Words and terms such as &quot;eco-friendly&quot;  or &quot;environmentally sensitive,&quot; while catchy and conveying a certain  benefit, have no true basis in fact.</p>
          <p class="text">In fewer  cases, the claims are intended to deceive you; the company is simply jumping on  the green bandwagon without the proper documentation and worse, little sincere  concern for the environmental impact of its products. The goal is to cash in on  the green movement, not contribute to it.<br />
            In both  cases, the effect is called &quot;greenwashing.&quot; It's something we as  professional builders confront all the time with our suppliers. And while it's  our job to ferret out true and impactful environmental claims from those that  are greenwashed before we offer those benefits to you for your new-home  project, we encourage our homeowners to take initiative and protect themselves,  as well.</p>
          <p class="text">Here are  some tactics you may find useful to avoid greenwashing:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text"><strong>Ask questions!</strong> With a little digging online or perhaps on the phone with the       manufacturer, you can discover the details of how a product is made and       quantify its green claims. If there is recycled content, for instance, you       should be able to find out how much and from what sources; if the product       claims to save water, the amount of anticipated savings based on a       baseline of use should be accessible. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text"><strong>Look for a label.</strong> Not all sincerely green products are certified by a       reputable third-party, such as the EPA's WaterSense or the federal Energy       Star programs (among several), but such labeling is a good (and easy)       piece of the puzzle. These programs verify quantifiable claims made by the       manufacturer regarding their environmental impact. If you see a label you       don't recognize, look it up online for more details and likely a list of       certified products. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text"><strong>Beware of hidden tradeoffs.</strong> Many products tout a narrow definition of an       environmental benefit but with a tradeoff somewhere else, such as a       product that uses recycled content but also contains or uses formaldehyde       or adhesives that emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We also look at       things like packaging, distance from the source (the closer the better),       and manufacturing processes that ideally reduce the environmental impact       of the product beyond a single green claim. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text"><strong>Realize relevance.</strong> The use of bad stuff like lead (in paints),       chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, in refrigerants), asbestos (in insulation and       roofing products), and arsenic (used to preserve wood products) has been       banned for decades. Still, some manufacturers now tout them as a       &quot;green&quot; benefit. Something that's &quot;lead-free&quot; should       be a given, not a sales pitch -- and certainly not considered green. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p class="text"><strong>Trust your gut.</strong> Common sense is always a good gauge; if something sounds too good to be       true, or at least overstated or exaggerated, check it out. If you get the       runaround or the company can't qualify its claims, find an alternative       that satisfies your needs and goals. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text">As your  builder, we consider it our responsibility to provide you with products and  systems that perform as promised. Greenwashing gets in the way of that goal,  while avoiding such claims helps deliver the environmental and resource  efficiencies you expect and desire.</p>
