                </p>
              <p>A:    Replacement windows are made specifically to the size of a given opening in a    particular house to precisely replace the home's existing, usually outdated,    windows. While &quot;stock&quot; windows are made and sold in a limited variety    of standard dimensions, replacement windows are custom-made to fit a    particular opening to preserve the scale and proportion of the original    windows.</p></td>

        <td height="1694" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><h1>Shedding  Light on Window Options </h1>
          <p>It wasn't  that long ago that a window was a window ... was a window. Basically, a hole in  the wall fitted with a wood-framed pane of glass that allowed a view to the  outside and provided a little bit of daylight into a house.<br />
            </p>
          <p>Over the  past 25 years, windows have changed dramatically. Not only are they far more  energy-efficient than their predecessors, they are available in a wide range of  styles, frames and glass options. Today, professional builders and homebuyers  are able to precisely align a window's energy performance, cost, and style to  achieve an optimum solution for any home.<br />
          </p>
          <p>Among an  increasing variety of window frame materials, here's how the tried-and-true  measure up to the next generation.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Aluminum:</strong> Light, durable, easy  to maintain, and generally inexpensive, aluminum-framed windows remain popular  across the country and where cost is an important consideration.<br />
          </p>
          <p>However,  metal is more thermally conductive than other window frame materials. It can be  difficult to maintain a steady level of indoor comfort and reduce heating  energy demand with an aluminum window. This is of particular concern in  extremely cold weather.<br />
          </p>
          <p>In those  conditions, the thermal conductivity of a metal-framed window may also cause  condensation that can result in latent moisture damage to the overall window  and adjacent materials. Aluminum frames with so-called &quot;thermal  breaks&quot; or spacers that separate the indoor and outdoor frame sections can  improve energy performance.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Wood:</strong> Wood-framed windows  are popular for their aesthetic qualities; wood also is a very good insulating  material, with low thermal conductivity.<br />
          </p>
          <p>The problem  with wood is maintenance, especially the part of the frame that's exposed to  weather. And, despite their insulating qualities, wood windows react to changes  in ambient moisture and temperature, which may cause them to stick (when they  swell in hot, humid weather) or create gaps (when they shrink in cold, dry  conditions).<br />
          </p>
          <p>To address  those issues, the exterior profile (or face) of wood-framed windows are often  fitted with a vinyl or aluminum cladding that protects the wood frame from  weather damage and reduces climate-caused fluctuations in the frame's  integrity. A cladding also maintains the aesthetic qualities of wood, as the  indoor section of the frame remains exposed and natural.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Vinyl:</strong> Window frames made  from polyvinylchloride (PVC) combine durability, low thermal conductivity, and  moisture resistance. They are generally affordable.<br />
          </p>
          <p>To improve  energy performance, some vinyl windows are infused or fitted with insulation  material within their mostly hollow frames.<br />
          </p>
          <p>The issue  with vinyl windows is aesthetics. They are available in a limited number of  colors, usually white or light hues, which may not be compatible with the rest  of a home's exterior finish materials.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>Composites  and Fiberglass:</strong> The latest generation of window frames seek to address the deficiencies of  their predecessors. So-called &quot;hybrid&quot; frames combine various  wood-based materials to achieve better stability, while wood-plastic composites  boost thermal performance and durability.<br />
            Fiberglass,  meanwhile, can be molded, shaped, textured, and colored to look like wood, but  with far superior durability and strength and better insulating value. To date,  fiberglass appears to be the window frame material of the future, with few  downsides.<br />
          </p>
          <p>That being  said, composites and fiberglass-framed windows are generally more expensive, but  also promise to deliver better and longer-lasting performance.<br />
          </p>
          <p>As a  professional builder, it is important that we educate ourselves about the  increasingly diverse options available for residential windows. This enables us  to advise our homebuyers about their choices and support them in making  informed decision about their new home.</p>
