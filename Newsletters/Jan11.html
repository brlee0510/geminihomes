          <p><em>Q: How does a tankless water heater work?</em></p>
A: Unlike a traditional  water heater with a storage tank, a tankless unit operates only when hot water  is needed for an appliance or hot-water-using fixture, such as a shower or tub.  Demand for hot water triggers the water heater to fire its gas/propane burner  or electric coils to heat water as it travels through coils. Without a tank,  the unit rarely runs out of hot water and there is no &quot;recovery time&quot;  as with a tank unit when hot water is not available.</td>

          <p><span class="text">You might  find it a little odd to consider hiring a new-home builder for your remodeling  project, but organizations like ours can oftentimes deliver a better project  than a traditional remodeling company that focuses on a range of home  improvement projects.<br />
              </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">For room  additions and major renovations that require structural work and a significant  amount of new construction, professional home builders are already equipped to  deliver a high level of quality and owner satisfaction.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Consider...large-scale  projects are often very similar to our new-home building work. A room addition,  for instance, is really not much different than a new home project,  encompassing the full range of construction phases and materials from the foundation  and structural frame through all of the exterior and interior finishes.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Because of  our experience in building new homes, we are accustomed to delivering a high  level of finish and are skilled at working closely with our clients to develop,  refine, and execute a quality job. We're also used to working under tight  deadlines and budgets, giving us a perspective -- and skill set -- that few  remodeling contractors can match.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Our new-home  work often affords us greater leverage than a remodeling contractor to  negotiate prices for materials and labor with our suppliers and trade partners.  We enjoy long-term relationships with our team of trade partners and they know  we'll have more work for them down the road, whether it's a new house or a  large-scale remodeling project.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">In addition  to those cost-saving strategies, we value engineer every project. This process  identifies and reduces unnecessary or redundant costs for materials and labor.  Unlike a typical remodeling operation, we employ staff with the experience and  expertise to recognize and rework your project early in the process. We also  order materials as we need them, rather than all at once, which can cut down on  theft, damage and eliminate the need to reorder.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Finally,  professional homebuilding companies like ours typically utilize more  sophisticated and reliable business practices than an average remodeling  contractor. And, because of our new-home work, we usually have a greater pool  of financial resources that keep headaches and cost overruns in check.<br />
            Those  combined savings help us to ensure that we meet your budget or align your  project with a budget that you can afford. In some cases, the money we save  through negotiation, value engineering, and a streamlined operation may allow  us to expand your project or upgrade the level of finish.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">No doubt,  there are some great remodeling contractors out there. But for large-scale room  additions and major home renovations, consider the skills a professional  builder brings to the table.</span></p>
          <span class="text">
Warm Regards,</span><br />
