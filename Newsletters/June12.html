                  <p><em>Q: Do photovoltaic panels convert 100% of the sun's energy into  electricity?</em></p>
A: No. In fact, the most  efficient PV panels convert only about 20% of the solar energy they collect  into usable AC electricity. That may not seem like a lot, but it is enough to  generate more than 300 watts of electricity per 20-square-foot panel.<p>&nbsp;</p></td>

          <p class="text">After a  40-year hiatus, solar energy is cool again. But for those who remember bulky  aluminum frames awkwardly balanced on the roof, the current look, use,  performance, and value of today's solar energy systems has changed  dramatically.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">As a  professional builder, we keep a sharp eye on products and systems that are  getting the public's attention so we can intelligently advise our homebuyer  clients about their validity and proper use. Today's solar energy systems --  for both domestic hot water and electricity -- have made significant strides  that, in the right circumstances, can reduce a homeowner's monthly energy  bills.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">The first  thing to remember is that solar energy systems are most effective and only  worth the investment if you add them to a house that's been designed and built  to reduce its energy consumption from the get-go -- in other words, a  high-performance new home. No solar panel or thermal collector will offset the  ills of a poorly-insulated, drafty house, and it is a waste of time and money  to consider it.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Also, solar  panels work best if they face south/southwest and are in full daylight; any  shading from trees or adjacent buildings (more so than clouds) render them far  less efficient at converting enough solar energy to offset their cost. That's one  of the first things we consider when a homeowner asks us about adding solar to  their new-home project.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">The good  news about solar is that today's photovoltaic or &quot;PV&quot; panels (for  electricity) and thermal collectors (for hot water) are more efficient at capturing  and converting the sun's energy while reducing their visual impact on the roof.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">A relatively  new breed of so-called &quot;roof-integrated&quot; PV panels are so sleek that  they lay almost flat on the roof; some are even formed to look like and run  flush to roof shingles and concrete barrel tiles to better integrate into the  roof finish. And, because modern solar cells are more efficient at converting  solar energy into electricity, a house needs fewer of them to satisfy its solar  energy needs.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">In addition,  most modern residential PV systems are designed to offset only a portion of a  home's electrical needs, not 100% like the old-school, off-the-grid designs of  the past. In fact, the panels are connected to the home's electrical service  box and meter, and any surplus energy they create is credited by the local  power utility, a cost-efficient practice called net-metering. In short, PV  arrays are designed to capture the most solar energy that's reasonable for  their optimal location on the roof, available sunlight, cost, and return on  investment.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">In addition,  federal energy tax credits for the purchase and installation of residential  solar energy systems are available through 2016, perhaps supplementing state or  local rebates or other financial incentives to deliver an even faster payback.</p>
          <p class="text">Solar energy isn't limited to rooftop panels.  Landscape lighting, attic fans, and other products can be powered by the sun,  as well. Though not connected to the grid like larger PV arrays, their use  offsets demand for utility-provided electricity to further reduce monthly  energy costs. </p>
          <p class="text">Warm Regards, </p>
