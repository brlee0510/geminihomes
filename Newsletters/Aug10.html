        </p>
          <p><em>Q: How do you measure square footage?</em></p>
A: In fact, there is a lot  of debate, and no set standard, for measuring a home's square footage -- which  is part of what makes a cost-per-square-foot calculation between two homes so  difficult to ascertain. Are you using the dimensions of the exterior outline of  the house, or interior room dimensions (the difference being the thickness of  the walls, which can add up)? Does the calculation distinguish between  conditioned or unconditioned space? Does it include the garage or basement or  unfinished areas? Until you define how to measure square footage, comparing  costs per square foot is even more irrelevant.</td>

        <td height="1694"><p><strong>The Cost Question </strong> <br />
            </p>
          <p><span class="text">A question  we get all the time is &quot;what's your price per square foot?&quot; The  perception (or presumption), we assume, is that if you wanted to add or  subtract a few square feet for whatever reason, you simply add or subtract that  amount per foot from the price or cost of the house.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Simply, in  our business, it doesn't work that way. For us, it's an impossible question to  answer without a lot more information and detail, and one that can only be  derived once the house is finished and all costs have been accounted for.  Before that, it's akin to asking, &quot;How much does a vacation cost?&quot;  without first knowing where and for how long you plan to go, and by what mode  of transportation, among other considerations.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">The fact is,  the details (and therefore cost) of every house -- even those built on  speculation by large-volume builders -- is different, and the cost of your  house is entirely up to you, not your builder. Only you know how much you can  afford and what you want in your new home. It's our job to apply our expertise  and experience to finely detail your wants and needs and then build a home that  meets (or ideally exceeds) those expectations while remaining within your  budget.<br />
            That's why  it is so important to determine and then share your budget with us from the  first moment you select us to build your home. Budget information should  precede any talk of contracts or actual construction. Using the vacation  analogy, we are like a travel agent working with you to plan a trip.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Still, the  square-foot cost question persists. So, it might be helpful to understand what  goes into or affects the cost (or ultimate price) of a new home to gain a  better perspective on the question.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">For  instance, the costs of similarly sized homes can vary considerably due to their  location (and even size and shape of the lot within the same neighborhood), the  outline of the building, the type of and complexity of the foundation and roof,  and many other construction and design characteristics that are not directly  related to the square footage of the house.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">In addition,  costs including development impact fees and permits, or state and municipality  mandated code requirements, can add from a few thousand to tens of thousands of  dollars to the ultimate cost of a new home, regardless of size. Labor and  material costs also can vary substantially based upon the time of year,  availability and demand of building materials and workers, weather conditions,  and the complexity of the project.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">The list of  variables goes on, and we're happy to discuss them with you and explain how  they might impact the cost of your new home. But, in our view, it's short-sighted  to ask us up-front what our homes cost per square foot, and certainly to base  one of the most important decisions of your life on that metric alone.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Better, we  think, to get a full understanding of our process and expertise and marry those  skills with what you can afford and want and need in a new home to achieve your  goals.</span></p>
<p><span class="text">Warm Regards,</span><br />
