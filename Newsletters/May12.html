                  <p><em>Q: What are the most effective energy-saving products?</em></p>
A: The vast majority of  home energy is used for space heating, water heating, and major appliances.  While it may be a good strategy to upgrade to the highest-efficiency models you  can afford, their ultimate performance relies in a well-built home that is  properly insulated and air-sealed.

        <td height="1694" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><h1>Excellence  vs. Perfection</h1>
          <p class="text">Famous football  coach Bill Walsh was known for demanding perfection from his players during  practices, even though he knew they would never attain it. His philosophy was  if you don't strive for perfection, you don't have a chance to achieve it.</p>
          <p class="text">As  professional builders, we follow the same philosophy; plan for perfection to  attain excellence. Like Coach Walsh, we don't stand a chance of delivering an  excellent new home that satisfies a client's wants and needs if we don't set  and expect the highest standards possible.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">In the  pursuit of excellence, we coach our homebuyers about the building process so  that their expectations are high but realistic. We want our homebuyers to push  and challenge us to always do better, but it is also our job to define  excellence ... and point out the difference between it and perfection.<br />
            Our best and  most effective method for doing that is listening. Really listening. Not just  to find out which floor plan a client prefers, but why and how it will satisfy  their lifestyle needs. Not just about which community they want to live in, but  also their concerns and questions about the quality of nearby schools,  proximity to shopping and public services, and commute routes to work.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">In this  discovery phase, we craft a strategy for a new home that truly addresses and  justifies our client's reasons for making such a significant investment and  sets us on course to deliver it according to those expectations.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">It is also  critical to maintain a regular and open line of communication during the  construction process. As during the planning stage, our first job is to listen  to and then educate and inform our buyers about the subtleties of new-home  construction that are specific to their concerns.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Responding  to a buyer's question with &quot;that's just the way it is&quot; or &quot;it's  complicated&quot; is unacceptable. Instead, we strive to deliver details,  demonstrate our methods, and ensure that questions are answered to a buyer's  satisfaction. That approach and level of respect for our buyers helps build a  better understanding of our work process all the way through the final  walk-through and close of escrow.<br />
            </p>
          <p class="text">Finally, a  key component of delivering excellence comes after the sale, once a buyer  becomes a homeowner. We make sure to communicate our policies and procedures  for warranty service -- once again demonstrating the difference between  perfection and excellence. Ideally, we've done an excellent job of building  their new home to the point where service callbacks are kept to a minimum; for  those small warranty items that crop up after move-in, we work to be responsive  and responsible to address them in a timely fashion.<br />
            As a  homebuyer and owner, it's okay to want the &quot;perfect&quot; home. The best  we can do, however, is to strive for perfection and achieve excellence that  satisfies the lifestyle needs of our clients and protects their investment now  and well into the future.</p>
          <p class="text">Warm Regards, </p>
