                  <p>Kelly,  Lisa and I wanted to take the time to say thank you. You made our dream home  wish come true. Working out the trade on our existing home was the only way we  could make the deal happen. You and your team made listing our house and  building our new one a stress free deal. I would like to also thank you for  always being there to explain and answer all our questions. Your ability to  keep me informed almost on a daily basis was greatly appreciated. We look  forward to raising our kids in this beautiful home. We couldn't have asked for  a better partner in this part of our lives. Thanks Jarrod and Lisa Beliles </p>

                  <p><em>Q: What is an energy audit?</em></p>
A: Home energy audits have  become popular as homeowners seek ways to lower their home energy bills. A typical  audit, performed by a trained and accredited local professional for a few  hundred dollars, will test the energy efficiency of your heating and cooling  equipment and water heating system, identify leaks or other inefficiencies in  the building envelope and ductwork, and suggest ways to reduce your energy use  with lifestyle changes and home improvements.</td>

        <td height="1694"><h1>Top  5 Questions: Builder References</h1>
          <p class="text">You just  left an impressive presentation with a professional homebuilder, one among the  few you're considering for your new home project.</p>
          <p class="text">In addition  to a brochure about his business and highlights of his recent work and the  communities in which he builds, he provided you with a list of recent  homebuyers for you to call or email to ask about his quality, ethics, skill,  and professionalism.<br />
            Now the  ball's in your court to actually reach out to those references and gain some  valuable inside knowledge about your builder before you consider negotiating  and signing a contract for your project.</p>
          <p class="text">But what to  ask? For many prospective homebuyers, we suggest a few questions to solicit the  kind of information that will help them make an informed and confident  decision. Of course, you may have your own agenda and priorities, which we  encourage; if you need them, these questions just may help get the conversation  going.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>1.  Was the company easy to work with?</strong> Ask how the builder managed communication  with the buyers before and during construction, ideally through one point of  contact (typically the site supervisor) with the authority to make or negotiate  decisions as opposed to a bureaucratic quagmire that is frustrating and  confusing.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>2.  Was the jobsite clean?</strong> The best builders leave the job site clean at the end of  each day. They sweep and haul their trash away, store or take their tools, and  stack their materials. Not only does the jobsite look good (as good as anything  can under construction), but also is one that's safer should the owners want to  check out the progress of the job on their own after work.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>3.  Did they finish on time?</strong> Finishing on time reveals the builder's  commitment and organizational skills. If the answer is &quot;no,&quot; dig a  little deeper into why; it may be that the owner made changes that caused some  delays, or that bad weather was an unavoidable factor.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>4.  Did they finish on budget?</strong> Like finishing on time (or within the  owner's expectations), finishing on budget indicates a builder's organizational  and business acumen, specifically his cost-estimating skills. If the answer is  &quot;no,&quot; ask why and look for clues about change or special orders by  the owners that may have been outside the scope of the original budget, or if  the builder neglected to calculate a cost and tried to make the owners pay for  it at closing.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>5.  Did they disappear after move-in?</strong> Perhaps a new-home owner's biggest worry is  what happens after they close escrow and move in. A builder who has been  available to answer questions and respond to reasonable warranty issues is an  important indicator of a builder's long-term commitment to the quality of his  homes and the ultimate satisfaction of their owners.</p>
          <p class="text">This handful  of questions probably does not satisfy all of your needs, but it's a start and  often will inspire more questions that further reveal whether the builder  you're considering is one you can trust and rely on to do the job right.</p>
          <span class="text"> Warm Regards,</span>
