            <strong>Building</strong><strong><br />
              <strong>Success 101 </strong></strong> <br />
            <em>Q: What's the most effective way to save energy?</em></p>
A: Meaningful and impactful  energy efficiency requires a comprehensive approach and commitment from the  home's design through construction and including the homeowners' lifestyle  habits. To pick just one method or material, such as attic insulation or  high-performance windows, is a step in the right direction. However, this is  only a small part of what could be accomplished by an all-inclusive approach.</td>

        <td height="1694"><p><strong>What is an Organized Builder? </strong> <br />
            <span class="text">Investing in  the design and construction of a new home is a daunting task, something most  people do once or maybe twice in a lifetime. The last thing you need is a  builder who doesn't have it together.<br />
</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Why does  that matter? Simply, homebuilding today is an increasingly complex endeavor,  involving dozens of trade partners and materials suppliers, requiring  compliance with building codes and other regulations, demanding financial savvy  and tight management, and calling for keen attention to every detail. This  demands a highly organized approach to the new home construction process.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">A hitch  along the way can have a big impact on quality, performance, durability and  satisfaction ... or it can be mitigated or avoided altogether to protect your  investment and give you peace of mind through the process and beyond.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">The  difference between these vastly different scenarios depends on how organized  your builder is.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">But what  does an organized builder look like, and how do you evaluate a builder's  ability to guide you through this time-consuming and sometimes confusing  process?<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">There are  several signs that indicate a professional builder's business acumen,  organizational skills, and other capabilities that help ensure ultimate  satisfaction with your new home.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Cleanliness.</strong> <span class="text">A clean and  organized job site can often reflect a builder's overall organizational  competency. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, a clean job site is safer for workers  and visiting homeowners, reducing liability. In addition, materials that are  properly stacked, staged, and covered reflect a concern for quality  construction and respect for the budget and schedule.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Responsiveness.</strong> <span class="text">The number-one  complaint among dissatisfied homebuyers is that their builder was slow to  respond, or never did. By contrast, an organized builder understands the  importance of being responsive from the first contact through completion and  beyond.</span></p>
          <p class="text">Often,  professional builders develop a process for responding to calls or emails from  potential and current clients, usually within 24 hours. They articulate that  policy upfront and follow it through to establish and maintain reliable  expectations.</p>
          <p><strong>Protection.</strong> <span class="text">Professional  builders don't allow themselves or their clients to be at risk. To mitigate and  prepare for hazards, they are fully insured and -- if required by law --  licensed and bonded. And if you ask about those protections, they'll provide  the necessary documentation and lead you to the proper agencies and  organizations for more information.<br />
            In addition,  an organized builder pays his subcontractors and materials suppliers from your  job (and only your job) on time and per his contracts with those partners. He  then collects lien releases once the contracts are satisfied (based on mutual  satisfaction with the work performed) to protect you from having any liens  placed against your property for unpaid services or products.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Passing  the baton.</strong> <span class="text">If you haven't yet noticed, organized builders work to make sure their clients  know what to expect throughout the building process ... including what happens  after move-in and beyond the expiration of the builder's service warranty.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Professional  builders know how and when to pass the baton for the care and maintenance of  the house to homeowners. This is an incremental process that logically shifts  responsibility over time rather than abandoning clients at the doorstep of  their new home. </span></p>
          <span class="text"> Warm Regards,</span><br />
