<p>Our  philosophy is simple: PROCESS is the Key! -&nbsp;You don't want a Builder  struggling to run a business...You want an organized Businessman who happens to  build outstanding Homes.&nbsp; Since every Builder can buy lumber from the same  yard and hire the same carpenter and electrician the quality and price of your  Home SHOULD be the same.&nbsp; Gemini Homes, Inc. will give you the quality you  deserve, but so will a lot of firms out there.&nbsp; We want you to hire us for  our PROCESS and the VALUE we can guarantee because of it.&nbsp; PIECE OF  MIND.&nbsp; EXPERT LEADERSHIP.&nbsp; EXPERT MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION.&nbsp;  ATTENTION TO DETAIL.&nbsp; IT ALL EQUALS AN OUTSTANDING EXPERIENCE!</p>

          <p><em>Q: What is the difference between markup and profit margin?</em></p>
A: Markup is what a builder  adds to the price of a given item, such as an appliance or lumber order, to  cover his overhead costs and achieve a reasonable profit margin on the project.  The profit margin is what he actually makes on that item after he pays his  overhead, such as office space, cell phone bill, vehicles and labor.

        <td height="1694"><p><strong>When  Cheap is Expensive</strong></p>
          <p><span class="text">Choosing a  builder based on the lowest cost per square foot or the lowest sales price is  likely not getting the best value. It's buying the cheapest home. No doubt  about it, there is some cheap housing out there right now, but is  &quot;cheap&quot; the best way to go?</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Common sense  tells us that there is a premium to be paid for a superior home. By that we  mean a home that has more exacting standards, performs well over time,  maintains its value as an investment and is built by a builder who stands by  his work. Let's take a closer look at these higher initial costs and why we  believe it is worth paying a reasonable premium for such a home.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Better  Materials. </strong><span class="text">Professional  builders who build to a high level of quality have higher standards for the  materials that go into their homes. They cull lumber piles for the straightest  studs and send the warped and knotted ones back to the lumberyard. They inspect  and confirm deliveries, protect materials from weather, seek out the best  warranties and track problems to weed out poor-performing materials.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">When a  company insists on that level of quality and provides that level of attention  and care, one would expect to pay a bit more. Like cheap houses, cheap  materials can deliver substandard results that often cost more to repair or  replace than the premium you might pay upfront for a higher-quality option.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Better  Construction. </strong><span class="text">Builders  who specify and only accept better-quality products do so to achieve a higher  level of overall construction quality and long-term durability. They make sure  products and materials are installed properly by the most competent  subcontractors and adhere to performance standards that are far beyond what the  local building code requires.<br />
            </span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Why? Because  professional builders know that their reputation is on the line with every home  they deliver. When homeowners begin to see evidence of poor workmanship, it  doesn't take long for them to spread the word about how poorly the builder (and  the house) performed. This is too high a price to pay for any company who is in  business for the long-term and understands the value of a satisfied client.<br />
              As with  better materials and products, a better-built home may (and should) cost more  upfront, but cost less over time. As we've seen repeatedly over the years, it  requires less repair, replacement and maintenance in the long run.</span><br />
            </p>
          <p><strong>A  Better Experience.</strong> <span class="text">Is it possible to put a price tag on peace of mind?  Consider the value of a hassle-free new-home project. Less stress, no hurt  feelings, no horror stories, no busted budgets, no lawsuits. What is it worth  to have your new home built on schedule, for the agreed cost, with a builder  who is there to answer your questions from groundbreaking through move-in and  beyond?</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">And what do  you get? A house that meets your expectations, that is solidly built, with  superior fit and finish. It's livable, comfortable, and meets your lifestyle  needs. In other words, a &quot;home.&quot; Your home.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">Warm Regards,</span><br />
