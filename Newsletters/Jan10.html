            </p>
          <p><em>Q: Why do builders sometimes send another company on a service  call?</em></p>
A: Increasingly, new-home  builders rely on a variety of trade (or specialty) contractors, such as  electricians, plumbers, and heating and cooling experts, to help build your new  house. Part of their contract is servicing their work; who better than the  person who installed your faucet to fix a leak? While the builder is ultimately  responsible for making sure warranty work is documented and performed, he will  rely on trade contractors to make warranty service call on his behalf, to his  standards, and to your satisfaction.</td>

        <td><p class="header2">What ever  happened to customer service?<br />
            </p>
<p class="text">Today,  simple respect and responsiveness seems to be more the exception than the rule  ... especially after the sale. How a homebuilder manages after-sale service,  also called warranty service or call-backs, is a key indicator of the company's  overall professionalism and ability to meet (and ideally exceed) a homebuyer's  expectations.</p>
          <p class="text">The goal of  the professional builder is to quickly and completely respond to and resolve  issues that come up during the time a home is under warranty. As a critical  part of providing great housing value and achieving customer satisfaction,  professional builders encourage questions from homebuyers and respond to their  concerns in a timely and respectful manner.</p>
          <p class="text">Typically, a  builder's warranty addresses specific issues with a home related to its  structural components (such as the foundation and frame), basic electrical and  other mechanical systems, and the quality of workmanship for a set time period.  How a builder responds to warranty service inquiries varies depending on the  policy offered and sold with the house: some are defined and managed entirely  by the builder, while others are defined, at least in part, by independent  agencies (such as an insurance company) and administered by the builder.</p>
          <p class="text">Specific  warranty language and procedures benefit both the builder and the homeowner.  Simply, a well-defined and properly communicated warranty service policy helps  eliminate confusion about who is responsible for issues, concerns, and other  call-back items that may occur in the first year or so of occupancy.</p>
          <p class="text">While there  are specific differences among builders, a superior warranty service program  includes:</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Documentation.</strong> A documented process  for responding to call-backs and customer service inquiries creates a  &quot;paper trail&quot; that ensures that questions and concerns are properly  communicated, managed, and resolved. A professional builder will document the  details of the warranty policy and keep track of inquiries, response time, and  specific types of service calls from the first call to follow-up to ensure the  homeowner's ultimate satisfaction.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Response  time.</strong> Responding to a service call is more an issue of timing than time; the key is  to understand which calls will be addressed immediately, and which may require  or allow more time. No one likes to wonder if or when a call or email will be  answered; if homeowners can depend on getting a reply from their builder within  a reasonable (or better still, stated) time frame, chances are better that  they'll be satisfied with how the issue is resolved.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Collective  calls.</strong> Even if a builder responds to a warranty service call within a day or so,  making a visit to the house to resolve a non-emergency situation may be timed  to coincide with other scheduled work at the house. This &quot;collective  call&quot; minimizes the number of times an owner needs to be at home to make  the house available to the builder's warranty service team. Of course,  emergency calls demand immediate attention, but collective calls can be a more  convenient and reliable way to address a variety of concerns or maintenance  issues at the same time.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Scheduled  visits.</strong> Professional builders are becoming more proactive in how they address scheduled  service and other routine maintenance work while a house is still under  warranty. In many cases, a builder will schedule a visit and &quot;walk  through&quot; (or tour) a new home within a month after occupancy. These visits  are opportunities for homeowners to ask questions and for the builder to  document or schedule service work covered by the warranty. Such visits also help  builders refine their warranty service processes based on a homeowner's  feedback.</p>
          <p class="text">No builder  follows exactly the same policies and procedures for warranty service,  inquiries and incidents. Our goal as building professionals is to provide each  client with the best new home buying and living experience possible. How  builders refine and improve their after the sale process goes a long way toward  delivering superior customer service and buyer satisfaction.</p>
