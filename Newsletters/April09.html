                  A: Home      maintenance is a topic rich in printed and online resources. Among a      library full of books, two of the best in terms of practicality and      usefulness are the New Fix-It-Yourself Manual: How to Repair, Clean, and      Maintain Anything and Everything In and Around Your Home from the editors      at Reader's Digest, and The Complete Photo Guide to Home Repair from      Creative Publishing International. Both are available at online and retail      booksellers. A good web site to check out is <a href="http://www.hometips.com" target="_blank">www.hometips.com</a>, which      provides information as well as links to several other resources.</span></p></td>

                <span class="text">The      great thing about a new house is that everything is, well, <em>new</em>. Nothing is      scratched, stained, or worn out. It's wonderful: Everything works! That's      one of the main attractions of buying a new home.<br />
              But, as      any homeowner knows, the rigors of day-to-day living can cause that      blissful new-home feeling to fade. It's an inevitable process, but one that      can be stemmed or slowed with proper maintenance of key systems and      finishes.<br />
              Once an      owner takes the keys to their new home, they become responsible for      maintenance of the entire structure and all its systems. Typically, professional      builders will ease that transition with a warranty, but ultimately the      baton is passed to the homeowners to protect their investment, enjoy the      comforts, <em>and</em> maintain (or increase) the value of their new home.<br />
              The      thought of staying on top of everything in a home can seem daunting, but      really, it comes down to common sense, some diligence, and a short list of      critical products and systems, including: </span></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li class="text"><em><strong>Heating and cooling</strong></em>. It's a simple thing everyone has heard before.           Changing the furnace filter every three months goes a long way toward           maintaining the proper operation of a home's entire air distribution           system. A clean filter keeps dust, moisture, and other allergens out           of the ductwork to help ensure fresh and healthy indoor air. Clean           filters and ducts also put an easier load on the furnace, prolonging           its life, and allow it to use less energy. Beyond that, homeowners           should have the ducts and carpets professionally cleaned every 2-3           years. </li>
                </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                  <li class="text"><em><strong>Drainage</strong>.</em> Rain and other sources of water, must be directed           away from the home to maintain the structural integrity of the           foundation. To preserve the drainage and watershed design of a house,           gutters should be inspected, and when necessary, cleaned and repaired           in the fall and early spring. Downspouts should have extensions or           splash blocks to direct or disperse runoff away from the house, if           they are not already installed. As new landscaping is added, the dirt           against the house (called &quot;backfill&quot;) must be checked again           to be sure that it continues to slope away from the structure.           Plantings should be set at least 18 inches away from the foundation,           as well. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul type="disc">
                  <li class="text"><em><strong>Roofing and siding</strong>. </em>A           new home's exterior finishes -- mainly roofing and siding materials --           are designed to last for at least 20 years and usually longer. That           being said, any cracks, voids, or other damage to these finishes can           lead to leaks and related moisture problems. Visually inspect the roof           and sidewalls of the house at least annually for the first five years           of ownership, and then semi-annually after that. And, of course, make           any repairs immediately. </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text">The      effort and consistency you put into maintaining your home will pay      dividends for you and your family in the future. Following these basic      maintenance tasks are key components in retaining your homes new look and      feel, while protecting the value of your investment.<br />
