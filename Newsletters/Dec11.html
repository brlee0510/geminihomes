              <p><em>Q: What's the most common job site safety hazard?</em></p>
              <p>A:    In residential construction, the most common hazards relate to falls, namely    from roofs or areas that are more than six feet above the ground. OSHA    reports that scaffolding, fall prevention, and ladders are among its top 5    most-frequently cited violations. They recently tightened standards to    further mitigate those hazards.</p></td>

        <td height="1694"><h1>Where's  the Value? New Homes, Existing Homes, Short Sales or Foreclosures</h1>
          <p class="text">In the  current housing economy, it's tempting to buy a &quot;short sale&quot; or  recently foreclosed home, especially one that was built during the recent  housing boom and is being offered at a bargain-basement price.</p>
          <p class="text">But that  strategy is full of pitfalls and potholes. It's well-documented that owners of  homes in foreclosure tend to neglect their property, knowing there's no point  in maintaining it. They are likely distraught and distracted at the prospect of  being evicted from their home, and understandably might focus on more important  things than fixing the gutters or repairing a leak.</p>
          <p class="text">The result  is often a home in poor condition with extra expenses required to bring it back  up to par, much less to your standards. After all, a home is the center of your  family's life, a safe haven, a shelter. Walking into a money pit of repairs and  service issues -- some of which you may not even know about until after you've  moved in -- threatens that security and quality of life. Is it worth the risk?</p>
          <p class="text">By  comparison, a newly built home provides you with exactly what you want from the  get-go. It reflects your specific needs now and into the future, as well as  your style and other aesthetic preferences. It's fresh, unblemished, and ready  for making memories.</p>
          <p class="text">A new home  offers other advantages over an existing home, and especially a short sales or  foreclosure, including:</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Better  Quality.</strong> As a professional builder, we are dedicated to delivering a high level of  construction and finish quality in our new homes. Not only do buyers demand  that our homes be better-built (and rightly so), but we also have the  knowledge, skill, strong trade partnerships, and commitment to continually  evaluate and refine our building practices and materials to improve that high  level of quality.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Better  Plans.</strong> We and other quality builders were offering &quot;customization&quot; long  before it was necessary to satisfy or attract potential homebuyers. That means  we work closely with you to determine your needs and find a floor plan and  house style that matches your tastes and lifestyle requirements.<br />
            The result  is a floor plan that is uniquely yours: functional, comfortable, flexible, and  efficient. Trying to find exactly what you want and need in that regard in a  foreclosed home or older house is unlikely, and probably would require  remodeling.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Better  Technology.</strong> Today's homes and their occupants demand a high level of technological  capability and convenience. Personal computers and other electronics have  become part of our daily lives. Homes now require a &quot;future-proofed&quot;  design that won't become obsolete anytime soon, everything from a docking and  sync station for smart phones to a network of cable and communication wire for  flat-screen televisions.</p>
          <p class="text">Technology  is moving so quickly these days that few homes built even five and certainly 10  or more years ago simply can't compete on that level, leaving you and your  family wanting (and needing) more. Current wiring and wireless networking  systems are available and increasingly affordable ... ready for the foreseeable  future.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Better  Service.</strong> If the recession taught the building industry anything, it's that customer  service needed to be improved. Existing homes, bank foreclosures, and short  sales offer zero service after the sale.</p>
          <span class="text"> Meanwhile, a professional builder offering a new  home tailored to your needs -- especially a company that survived the downturn  -- is well equipped and eager to make sure the experience is satisfying from  start to well past the finish, giving you peace of mind and the highest quality  living environment.</span>
          <p><span class="text"> Warm Regards,<br />
