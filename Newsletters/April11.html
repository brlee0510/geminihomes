  <strong>Building</strong><strong><br />
  <strong>Success 101 </strong></strong> <br />
  <em>Q: What is a &quot;rough-in&quot;?</em></p>
A: &quot;Rough-in&quot; is  a construction term that refers to the infrastructure or &quot;guts&quot; of a  particular system in a house. This can include the pipes for the plumbing  fixtures or the ducts for the heating and cooling equipment. Some rough-ins may  be left &quot;capped&quot; (or &quot;stubbed&quot;) behind a finished wall or  ceiling for the homeowner to add a product later, as the budget allows or as  part of a planned expansion project.</td>

            </p>
          <p class="text">In today's  recovering economy, everyone is price conscious. New-home construction is  certainly no exception. As a professional builder, we understand how critical  it is to establish and maintain a budget that everyone can both agree and rely  upon from ground breaking to the final walk-through.</p>
          <p class="text"><br />
            <img src="http://www.thebuildersnewsletter.com/images/040511.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" id="_x0000_i2" /></p>
          <p class="text">When it comes to  money, no one likes cost overruns or unpleasant surprises.</p>
          <p class="text">Builders are  no exception. When a project's budget is busted, it's unlikely that the builder  profits from it. More often than not, it's a cost that the company shares with  the homebuyer. Going over budget not only erodes a builder's profit, but his  reputation and potential for referrals as well.<br />
            </p>
          <p><span class="text">As a professional  builder, we are diligent about establishing a budget and actively managing that  budget through construction for each new home we build. It is in everyone's  best interest to make sure it stays on track.<br />
            Here are  some methods we employ to accomplish that goal:</span><br />
            </p>
          <p><strong>Value  engineering</strong>.  <span class="text">Value engineering is the practice of optimizing construction costs while  maintaining (or ideally improving) housing performance and durability. It  requires that the builder be on the project team from the outset, working with  you and your design professional to identify and make the best use of materials  and refine construction costs of your new home before breaking ground.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Negotiated  subcontracts</strong>.  <span class="text">The goal here is to attract the most talented and highest quality trade  partners at the best possible price. The best builders have a stable of  reliable and professional trade contractors with whom they work on a regular  basis. Rather than focus on lowest price, and risk dropping his quality  standards, a professional builder will take the plans and specifications to his  best subs and negotiate a set cost for their work. After negotiations, those  numbers are added to the budget and the contractors are held to their original  estimates.</span></p>
          <p><strong>Price  guarantees</strong>.<span class="text"> Similar to negotiating with their trade partners, professional builders may  seek to get guaranteed pricing from their materials suppliers as early, and for  as long, as possible. Placing a pre-determined ceiling on prices is critical  when material costs, such as lumber or copper, are volatile and likely to rise  even before construction begins.</span><br />
            </p>
          <p><strong>Details,  details</strong>.  <span class="text">Costs are more easily kept in check when every penny is tied to either a  specific stage of the process (such as rough framing or roofing) or materials  or products (such as a dishwasher or garage door). In this way, professional  builders are able to track specific costs to a detailed scope of work and  materials list.</span><br />
            </p>
          <p><strong>Tracking  costs</strong>.  <span class="text">Professional builders don't wait until the end of the job to find out if they  are &quot;on budget&quot;. They set several key milestones during construction  to make sure costs match the amount of work that's been completed. Tracking  costs during the project allows discrepancies to be caught early, frequently  before they impact the overall budget.</span><br />
            </p>
          <p><strong>Tracking  changes</strong>.  <span class="text">While change orders are a part of virtually every home we build, they are the  cause of most cost overruns and time delays during a new-home construction  project.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">This is not  an area to leave to chance. Smart builders plan for change. They have formal  policies and procedures in place to manage change requests and payments. These  procedures make any changes to the scope of work as efficient as possible,  minimizing cost overruns and time delays.</span></p>
          <p><span class="text">These  strategies go a long way to ensuring cost control on a new-home project,  protecting everyone from an unpleasant experience and helping ensure a high  level of quality and customer satisfaction.</span></p>
          <span class="text"> Warm Regards,</span><br />
