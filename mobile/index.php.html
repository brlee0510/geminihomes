        <h2>Home Builder Experience</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kelly Arnold, and his wife Kristy,   established Gemini Homes  in 1995, to build custom homes in Bowling   Green, Kentucky and surrounding areas.  Kelly has served as President of   the Builders  Association of South Central Kentucky (still an active   member), is a member of  the National Home Builders Association,   National Association of Home Builders‘Builder  20 Program (a    National Association of Home Builders program comprised of 20 builders   from  across the nation that exchange ideas and innovations related to   the custom  home market) and Bowling Green Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the years, Gemini Homes has built over   100 custom and  speculative homes in and around the Bowling Green /   Warren County area, not to  mention numerous home renovations. </p>
        <p>Starting his first construction job in 1978   (as a Sophomore  in high school), Kelly brings over 30 years of   construction experience to every  project.  He is a skilled carpenter,   with  an extensive knowledge of building materials, codes / processes   and customer  preferences.  This many years of  experience allows him to   guide the customer through the design / building  process with a wealth   of experience of “what works and what doesn’t”.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kelly has not only served on numerous boards / committees,    to benefit the quality of home building / businesses in the Bowling   Green and  surrounding areas, but has also lobbied at the KY state   capitol for the same  purposes to benefit <em><u>all</u></em> of  Kentucky.</p>

        <p><img src="../images/kelly-arnold.jpg" alt="Kelly Arnold" align="right" border="0" height="269" width="250" hspace="10">Kelly   was born and raised in Ohio County, on the outskirts  of the rural   farming community of Cromwell, Kentucky.  He is the youngest of 6   children; his father  working heavy construction and mother a home   maker.  For a family of 9 (2 parents, 5 siblings and a  grandmother)   living in a 900 square foot home with two bedrooms, Kelly, at an  early   age, began thinking of ‘how can we improve this housing situation’?</p>
        <p>Kelly and Kristy live on the outskirts of Bowling Green,  with their 3 daughters close by and 7 beautiful grandchildren.</p>

<h2>Customer Reviews<span class="tag"></span></h2>
        
        <blockquote>
         <p>This is our 2nd Gemini home. The fact that we returned to the same builder for a second time speaks to our extreme satisfaction with the home quality and home building experience. We both hope we don't have to relocate again, but if we do, we will be sure to return to a Gemini home. ~ Felicia and Daryl Judd</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p> We are writing to express our sincere gratitude for the quality work performed at our home during a recent renovation project which included the kitchen and great room. The attention to detail, design ideas and solutions provided all contributed to the timely transformation of our home. The end results is a modern, fucntional living area with an added bonus in the way of a new master bedroom closet. We have done a couple of remodels on previous homes but this has been, by far, the best contractor experience ever. ~ Clay and Sarah</p></blockquote>
